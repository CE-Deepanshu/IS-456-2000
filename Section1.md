# **SECTION 1 GENERAL**

## **1 SCOPE**

**1.1** This standard deals with the general structural use of plain and reinforced concrete.  

**1.1.1** For the purpose of this standard, plain concrete structures are those where reinforcement, if provided, is ignored for determination of strength of the structure.  

**1.2** Special requirements of structures, such as shells, folded plates, arches, bridges, chimneys, blast-resistant structures, hydraulic structures, liquid retaining structures, and earthquake-resistant structures, covered in respective standards, have not been covered in this standard; these standards shall be used in conjunction with this standard.
