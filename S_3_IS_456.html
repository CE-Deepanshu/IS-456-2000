    <div class="section-title">SECTION 3 GENERAL DESIGN CONSIDERATION</div>
</div>

<div class="section-box">
    <div class="section-title">18 BASES FOR DESIGN</div>
    
    <p class="bold">18.1 Aim of Design</p>
    <p>The aim of design is the achievement of an acceptable probability that structures being designed will perform satisfactorily during their intended life. With an appropriate degree of safety, they should sustain all the loads and deformations of normal construction and use and have adequate durability and adequate resistance to the effects of misuse and fire.</p>
    
    <p class="bold">18.2 Methods of Design</p>
    
    <p class="bold">18.2.1</p>
    <p>Structure and structural elements shall normally be designed by Limit State Method. Account should be taken of accepted theories, experiment and experience and the need to design for durability. Calculations alone do not produce safe, serviceable and durable structures. Suitable materials, quality control, adequate detailing and good supervision are equally important.</p>
    
    <p class="bold">18.2.2</p>
    <p>Where the Limit State Method can not be conveniently adopted, Working Stress Method (see Annex B) may be used.</p>
    
    <p class="bold">18.2.3 Design Based on Experimental Basis</p>
    <p>Designs based on experimental investigations on models or full size structure or element may be accepted if they satisfy the primary requirements of 18.1 and subject to experimental details and the analysis connected therewith being approved by the engineer-in-charge.</p>
    
    <p class="bold">18.2.3.1</p>
    <p>Where the design is based on experimental investigation on full size structure or element, load tests shall be carried out to ensure the following:</p>
    
    <p>a) The structure shall satisfy the requirements for deflection (see 23.2) and cracking (see 35.3.2) when subjected to a load for 24 h equal to the characteristic load multiplied by 1.33 y, where Y shall be taken from Table 18, for the limit state of serviceability. If within 24 h of the removal of the load, the structure does not show a recovery of at least 75 percent of the maximum deflection shown during the 24 h under the load, the test loading should be repeated after a lapse of 72 h. The recovery after the second test should be at least 75 percent of the maximum deflection shown during the second test.</p>
    
    <p class="note">NOTE: If the maximum deflection in mm, shown during 24 h under load is less than 40 P/D where I is the effective span in m; and D is the overall depth of the section in mm, it is not necessary for the recovery to be measured.</p>
    
    <p>b) The structure shall have adequate strength to sustain for 24 h, a total load equal to the characteristic load multiplied by 1.33 y, where y, shall be taken from Table 18 for the limit state of collapse.</p>
    
    <p class="bold">18.3 Durability, Workmanship and Materials</p>
    <p>It is assumed that the quality of concrete, steel and other materials and of the workmanship, as verified by inspections, is adequate for safety, serviceability and durability.</p>
    
    <p class="bold">18.4 Design Process</p>
    <p>Design, including design for durability, construction and use in service should be considered as a whole. The realization of design objectives requires compliance with clearly defined standards for materials, production, workmanship and also maintenance and use of structure in service.</p>
</div>

<div class="section-box">
    <div class="section-title">19 LOADS AND FORCES</div>
    
    <p class="bold">19.1 General</p>
    <p>In structural design, account shall be taken of the dead, imposed and wind loads and forces such as those caused by earthquake, and effects due to shrinkage, creep, temperature, etc, where applicable.</p>
    
    <p class="bold">19.2 Dead Loads</p>
    <p>Dead loads shall be calculated on the basis of unit weights which shall be established taking into consideration the materials specified for construction.</p>
    
    <p class="bold">19.2.1</p>
    <p>Alternatively, the dead loads may be calculated on the basis of unit weights of materials given in IS 875 (Part 1). Unless more accurate calculations are warranted, the unit weights of plain concrete and reinforced concrete made with sand and gravel or crushed natural stone aggregate may be taken as 24 kN/m² and 25 kN/m² respectively.</p>
    
    <p class="bold">19.3 Imposed Loads, Wind Loads and Snow Loads</p>
    <p>Imposed loads, wind loads and snow loads shall be assumed in accordance with IS 875 (Part 2), IS 875 (Part 3) and IS 875 (Part 4) respectively.</p>
    
    <p class="bold">19.4 Earthquake Forces</p>
    <p>The earthquake forces shall be calculated in accordance with IS 1893.</p>
    
    <p class="bold">19.5 Shrinkage, Creep and Temperature Effects</p>
    <p>If the effects of shrinkage, creep and temperature are liable to affect materially the safety and serviceability of the structure, these shall be taken into account in the calculations (see 6.2.4, 6.2.5 and 6.2.6) and IS 875 (Part 5).</p>
    
    <p class="bold">19.5.1</p>
    <p>In ordinary buildings, such as low rise dwellings whose lateral dimension do not exceed 45 m, the effects due to temperature fluctuations and shrinkage and creep can be ignored in design calculations.</p>
    
    <p class="bold">19.6 Other Forces and Effects</p>
    <p>In addition, account shall be taken of the following forces and effects if they are liable to affect materially the safety and serviceability of the structure:</p>
    
    <p>a) Foundation movement (see IS 1904),</p>
    <p>b) Elastic axial shortening,</p>
    <p>c) Soil and fluid pressures [see IS 875 (Part 5)],</p>
    <p>d) Vibration,</p>
    <p>e) Fatigue,</p>
    <p>f) Impact [see IS 875 (Part 5)],</p>
    <p>g) Erection loads [see IS 875 (Part 2)], and</p>
    <p>h) Stress concentration effect due to point load and the like.</p>
    
    <p class="bold">19.7 Combination of Loads</p>
    <p>The combination of loads shall be as given in IS 875 (Part 5).</p>
    
    <p class="bold">19.8 Dead Load Counteracting Other Loads and Forces</p>
    <p>When dead load counteracts the effects due to other loads and forces in structural member or joint, special care shall be exercised by the designer to ensure adequate safety for possible stress reversal.</p>
    
    <p class="bold">19.9 Design Load</p>
    <p>Design load is the load to be taken for use in the appropriate method of design; it is the characteristic load in case of working stress method and characteristic load with appropriate partial safety factors for limit state design.</p>
</div>

<div class="section-box">
    <div class="section-title">20 STABILITY OF THE STRUCTURE</div>
    
    <p class="bold">20.1 Overturning</p>
    <p>The stability of a structure as a whole against overturning shall be ensured so that the restoring moment shall be not less than the sum of 1.2 times the maximum overturning moment due to the characteristic dead load and 1.4 times the maximum overturning moment due to the characteristic imposed loads. In cases where dead load provides the restoring moment, only 0.9 times the characteristic dead load shall be considered. Restoring moment due to imposed loads shall be ignored.</p>
    
    <p class="bold">20.1.1</p>
    <p>The anchorages or counterweights provided for overhanging members (during construction and service) should be such that static equilibrium should remain, even when overturning moment is doubled.</p>
    
    <p class="bold">20.2 Sliding</p>
    <p>The structure shall have a factor against sliding of not less than 1.4 under the most adverse combination of the applied characteristic forces. In this case only 0.9 times the characteristic dead load shall be taken into account.</p>
    
    <p class="bold">20.3 Probable Variation in Dead Load</p>
    <p>To ensure stability at all times, account shall be taken of probable variations in dead load during construction, repair or other temporary measures. Wind and seismic loading shall be treated as imposed loading.</p>
    
    <p class="bold">20.4 Moment Connection</p>
    <p>In designing the framework of a building provisions shall be made by adequate moment connections or by a system of bracings to effectively transmit all the horizontal forces to the foundations.</p>
    
    <p class="bold">20.5 Lateral Sway</p>
    <p>Under transient wind load the lateral sway at the top should not exceed H/500, where H is the total height of the building. For seismic loading, reference should be made to IS 1893.</p>
</div>

<div class="section-box">
    <div class="section-title">21 FIRE RESISTANCE</div>
    
    <p class="bold">21.1</p>
    <p>A structure or structural element required to have fire resistance should be designed to possess an appropriate degree of resistance to flame penetration; heat transmission and failure. The fire resistance of a structural element is expressed in terms of time in hours in accordance with IS 1641. Fire resistance of concrete elements depends upon details of member size, cover to steel reinforcement detailing and type of aggregate (normal weight or light weight) used in concrete. General requirements for fire protection are given in IS 1642.</p>
    
    <p class="bold">21.2</p>
    <p>Minimum requirements of concrete cover and member dimensions for normal-weight aggregate concrete members so as to have the required fire resistance shall be in accordance with 26.4.3 and Fig.1 respectively.</p>
    
    <p class="bold">21.3</p>
    <p>The reinforcement detailing should reflect the changing pattern of the structural section and ensure that both individual elements and the structure as a whole contain adequate support, ties, bonds and anchorages for the required fire resistance.</p>
    
    <p class="bold">21.3.1</p>
    <p>Additional measures such as application of fire resistant finishes, provision of fire resistant false ceilings and sacrificial steel in tensile zone, should be adopted in case the nominal cover required exceeds 40 mm for beams and 35 mm for slabs, to give protection against spalling.</p>
    
    <p class="bold">21.4</p>
    <p>Specialist literature may be referred to for determining fire resistance of the structures which have not been covered in Fig. 1 or Table 16A.</p>

    <div class="section-title">22 ANALYSIS</div>
    
    <p class="bold">22.1 General</p>
    <p>All structures may be analyzed by the linear elastic theory to calculate internal actions produced by design loads. In lieu of rigorous elastic analysis, a simplified analysis as given in 22.4 for frames and as given in 22.5 for continuous beams may be adopted.</p>
    
    <p class="bold">22.2 Effective Span</p>
    <p>Unless otherwise specified, the effective span of a member shall be as follows:</p>
    
    <p>a) Simply Supported Beam or Slab—The effective span of a member that is not built integrally with its supports shall be taken as clear span plus the effective depth of slab or beam or centre to centre of supports, whichever is less.</p>
    
    <p>b) Continuous Beam or Slab — In the case of continuous beam or slab, if the width of the support is less than 1/12 of the clear span, the effective span shall be as in 22.2 (a). If the supports are wider than 1/12 of the clear span or 600 mm whichever is less, the effective span shall be taken as under:</p>
    
    <p>1) For end span with one end fixed and the other continuous or for intermediate spans, the effective span shall be the clear span between supports;</p>
    
    <p>2) For end span with one end free and the other continuous, the effective span shall be equal to the clear span plus half the effective depth of the beam or slab or the clear span plus half the width of the discontinuous support, whichever is less;</p>
    
    <p>3) In the case of spans with roller or rocket bearings, the effective span shall always be the distance between the centres of bearings.</p>
    
    <p>c) Cantilever — The effective length of a cantilever shall be taken as its length to the face of the support plus half the effective depth except where it forms the end of a continuous beam where the length to the centre of support shall be taken.</p>
    
    <p>d) Frames — In the analysis of a continuous frame, centre to centre distance shall be used.</p>
    
    <p class="bold">22.3 Stiffness</p>
    
    <p class="bold">22.3.1 Relative Stiffness</p>
    <p>The relative stiffness of the members may be based on the moment of inertia of the section determined on the basis of any one of the following definitions:</p>
    
    <p>a) Gross section — The cross-section of the member ignoring reinforcement;</p>
    
    <p>b) Transformed section — The concrete cross- section plus the area of reinforcement transformed on the basis of modular ratio (see B-1.3); or</p>
    
    <p>c) Cracked section — The area of concrete in compression plus the area of reinforcement transformed on the basis of modular ratio.</p>
    
    <p>The assumptions made shall be consistent for all the members of the structure throughout any analysis.</p>
    
    <p class="bold">22.3.2</p>
    <p>For deflection calculations, appropriate values of moment of inertia as specified in Annex C should be used.</p>
    
    <p class="bold">22.4 Structural Frames</p>
    <p>The simplifying assumptions as given in 22.4.1 to 22.4.3 may be used in the analysis of frames.</p>
    
    <p class="bold">22.4.1 Arrangement of Imposed Load</p>
    
    <p>a) Consideration may be limited to combinations of:</p>
    <p>1) Design dead load on all spans with full design imposed load on two adjacent spans; and</p>
    <p>2) Design dead load on all spans with full design imposed load on alternate spans.</p>
    
    <p>b) When design imposed load does not exceed three-fourths of the design dead load, the load arrangement may be design dead load and design imposed load on all the spans.</p>
    
    <p class="note">NOTE — For beams and slabs continuous over support 22.4.1(a) may be assumed.</p>
    
    <p class="bold">22.4.2 Substitute Frame</p>
    <p>For determining the moments and shears at any floor or roof level due to gravity loads, the beams at that level together with columns above and below with their far ends fixed may be considered to constitute the frame.</p>
    
    <p class="bold">22.4.2.1</p>
    <p>Where side sway consideration becomes critical due to un symmetry in geometry or loading, rigorous analysis may be required.</p>
    
    <p class="bold">22.4.3</p>
    <p>For lateral loads, simplified methods may be used to obtain the moments and shears for structures that are symmetrical. For unsymmetrical or very tall structures, more rigorous methods should be used,</p>
    
    <p class="bold">22.5 Moment and Shear Coefficients for Continuous Beams</p>
    
    <p class="bold">22.5.1</p>
    <p>Unless more exact estimates are made, for beams of uniform cross-section which support substantially uniformly distributed loads over three or more spans which do not differ by more than 15 percent of the longest, the bending moments and shear forces used in design may be obtained using the coefficients given in Table 12 and Table 13 respectively.</p>
    
    <p>For moments at supports where two unequal spans meet or in case where the spans are not equally loaded, the average of the two values for the negative moment at the support may be taken for design.</p>
    
    <p>Where coefficients given in Table 12 are used for calculation of bending moments, redistribution referred to in 22.7 shall not be permitted.</p>
    
    <p class="bold">22.5.2 Beams and Slabs Over Free End Supports</p>
    <p>Where a member is built into a masonry wall which develops only partial restraint, the member shall be designed to resist a negative moment at the face of the support of WI/24 where W is the total design load and I is the effective span, or such other restraining moment as may be shown to be applicable. For such a condition shear coefficient given in Table 13 at the end support may be increased by 0.05.</p>
