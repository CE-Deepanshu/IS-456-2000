<p><b>6.2.1.1</b> . For concrete of grade M 30 and above, the rate of increase of compressive strength with age shall be based on actual investigations.</p>

<p><b>6.2.1.2</b> Where members are subjected to lower direct load during construction, they should be checked for stresses resulting from combination of direct load and , bending during construction.</p>

<p><b>6.2.2</b> Tensile Strength of Concrete The flexural and splitting tensile strengths shall be obtained as described in IS 516 and 185816 respectively. When the designer wishes to use an estimate of the tensile strength from the compressive strength, the following formula may be used:</p>

<div class="equation">

<p>where f<sub>ck</sub> is the characteristic cube compressive strength of concrete in N/mm<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p><b>6.2.3</b> Elastic Deformation The modulus of elasticity is primarily influenced by the elastic properties of the aggregate and to a lesser extent by the conditions of curing alld age of the concrete, the mix proportions and the type of cement. The modulus of elasticity is normally related to the compressive strength of concrete.</p>

<p><b>6.2.3</b> Elastic Deformation</p>

<p>The modulus of elasticity is primarily influenced by the elastic properties of the aggregate and to a lesser extent by the conditions of curing alld age of the concrete, the mix proportions and the type of cement. The modulus of elasticity is normally related to the compressive strength of concrete.</p>

<p><b>6.2.3.1</b> The modulus of elasticity of concrete can be assumed as follows:</p>

<div class="equation">
    <p>E<sub>c</sub> = 5000 √f<sub>ck</sub></p>
</div>

<p>where</p>
<p>E<sub>c</sub> is the short term static modulus of elasticity in N/mm². Actual measured values may differ by ± 20 percent from the values obtained from the above expression.</p>

<p><b>6.2.4</b> Shrinkage The total shrinkage of concrete depends upon the constituents of concrete, size of the member and environmental conditions. For a given humidity and temperature, the total shrinkage of concrete is most influenced by the total amount of water present in the concrete at the time of mixing and, to a lesser extent, by the cement content.</p>

<p><b>6.2.4.1</b> In the absence of test data, the approximate value of the total shrinkage strain for design may be taken as 0.0003 (for more information, see IS 1343).</p>

<p><b>6.2.5</b> Creep of Concrete Creep of concrete depends, in addition to the factors listed in 6.2.4, on the stress in the concrete, age at loading and the duration of loading. As long as the stress in concrete does not exceed one-third of its characteristic compressive strength, creep may be assumed to be proportional to the stress .</p>

<p><b>6.2.5.1</b> In the absence of experimental data and detailed information on the effect of the variables, the ultimate creep strain may be estimated from the following values of creep coefficient (that is, ultimate creep strain! elastic strain at the age of loading); for long span structure, it is advisable to, determine actual creep strain, likely to take place.</p>

    <b>8 DURABILITY OF CONCRETE</b>

<p><b>8.1 General</b></p>
<p>A durable concrete is one that performs satisfactorily in the working environment during its anticipated exposure conditions during service. The materials and mix proportions specified and used should be such as to maintain its integrity and, if applicable, to protect embedded metal from corrosion.</p>

<p><b>8.1.1</b> One of the main characteristics influencing the durability of concrete is its permeability to the ingress of water, oxygen, carbon dioxide, chloride, sulphate and other potentially deleterious substances. Impermeability is governed by the constituents and workmanship used in making the concrete. With normal-weight aggregates a suitably low permeability is achieved by having an adequate cement content, sufficiently low free water cement ratio, by ensuring complete compaction of the concrete, and by adequate curing.</p>

<p>The factors influencing durability include:</p>
<p>a) the environment;</p>
<p>b) the cover to embedded steel;</p>
<p>c) the type and quality of constituent materials;</p>
<p>d) the cement ·content and water - cement ratio of the concrete;</p>
<p>e) workmanship, to obtain full compaction and efficient curing; and</p>
<p>f) the shape and size of the member.</p>

<p>The degree of exposure anticipated for the concrete during its service life together with other relevant factors relating to mix composition, workmanship, design and detailing should be considered. The concrete mix to provide adequate durability under these conditions should be chosen taking account of the accuracy of testing regimes for control and compliance as described in this standard.</p>

<b>8.2 Requirements for Durability</b>

<p><b>8.2.1</b> Shape and Size of Member</p>
<p>The shape or design details of exposed structures should be such as to promote good drainage of water and to avoid standing pools and rundown of water. Care should also be taken to minimize any cracks that may collect or transmit water. Adequate curing is essential to avoid the harmful effects of early loss of moisture (see 13.5).Member profiles and their intersections with other members shall be designed and detailed in a way to ensure easy flow of concrete and proper compaction during concreting.</p>

<p>Concrete is more vulnerable to deterioration due to chemical or climatic attack when it is in thin sections, in sections under hydrostatic pressure from one side only, in partially immersed sections and at corners and edges of elements. The life of the structure can be lengthened by providing extra cover to steel, by chamfering the corners or by using circular cross sections or by using surface coatings which prevent or reduce the ingress of water, carbon dioxide or aggressive chemicals.</p>

<p><b>8.2.2</b> Exposure Conditions</p>

<p><b>8.2.2.1</b> General environment</p>
<p>The general environment to which the concrete will be exposed during its working life is classified into five levels of severity, that is, mild, moderate, severe, very severe and extreme as described in Table 3.</p>

<p><b>8.2.2.2</b> Abrasive</p>
<p>Specialist literatures may be referred to for durability requirements of concrete surfaces exposed to abrasive action, for example, in case of machinery and metal tyres.</p>

<p><b>8.2.2.3</b> Freezing and thawing</p>
<p>Where freezing and thawing actions under wet conditions exist, enhanced durability can be obtained by the use of suitable air entraining admixtures. When concrete lower than grade M 50 is used under these conditions, the mean total air content by volume of the fresh concrete at the time .of delivery into the construction should be:</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Nominal Maximum Size Aggregate (mm)</th>
        <th>Entrained Air Percentage</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>20</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>10 & 12.5</td>
        <td>6 ± 1</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>Since air entrainment reduces the strength, suitable adjustments may be made in the mix design for achieving required strength.</p>

<p><b>8.2.2.4</b> Exposure to sulphate attack Table 4 gives recommendations for the type of cement, maximum free water/cement ratio and minimum cement content, which are required at different sulphate concentrations in near-neutral ground water having pH of 6 to 9.</p>

<p>For the very high sulphate concentrations in Class 5 conditions, some form of lining such as polyethylene or polychloroprene sheet; or surface coating based on asphalt, chlorinated rubber, epoxy; or polyurethane' materials should also be used to prevent access by the sulphate solution.</p>

<p><b>8.2.3</b> Requirement of Concrete Cover</p>

<p><b>8.2.3.1</b> The protection of the steel in concrete against corrosion depends upon an adequate thickness of good quality concrete .</p>

<p><b>8.2.3.2</b> The nominal cover to the reinforcement shall be provided as per 26.4.</p>

<p><b>8.2.4</b> Concrete Mix Proportions</p>

<p><b>8.2.4.1</b> General</p>
<p>The free water-cement ratio is an important factor in governing the durability of concrete and should all ways be the lowest value. Appropriate values for minimum cement content and the maximum free water-cement ratio are given in Table 5 for different exposure conditions. The minimum cement content and maximum water-cement ratio apply to 20 mm nominal maximum size aggregate. For other sizes of aggregate they should be changed as given in Table 6.</p>

<p><b>8.2.4.2</b> Maximum cement content</p>
<p>Cement content not including fly ash and ground granulated blast furnace slag in excess of 450 kg/m<sup>3</sup> should not be used unless special consideration has been given in design to the increased risk of cracking due to drying shrinkage in. thin sections, or to early thermal cracking and to the increased risk of damage due to alkali silica reactions.</p>

    <b>Notes</b><br>
    1. Cement content given in this table is irrespective of grades of cement.<br>
    2. Use of supersulphated cement is generally restricted where the prevailing temperature is above 40°C.<br>
    3. Supersulphated cement gives an acceptable life provided that the concrete is dense and prepared with a water - cement ratio of 0.4 or less, in mineral acids, down to pH 3.5.<br>
    4. The cement contents given in col 6 of this table are the minimum recommended. For SOI contents near the upper limit of any class, cement contents above these minimum are advised. For purpose of calculations of SO3 context if the test results are in the form of SO3, following shall be used SO<sub>3</sub> = 0.833SO<sub>4</sub><br>
    5. For severe conditions, such as thin sections under hydrostatic pressure on one side only and sections partly immersed, considerations should be given to a further reduction of water - cement ratio.<br>
    6. Portland Pozzolana Cement conforming to IS 1489 (Part 1) having at least 25% of flyash content. Portland slag cement conforming to IS' 455 with slag content more than 50 percent slag content give acceptable sulphate resisting properties.<br>
    7. Where chloride is encountered along with sulphates in soil or ground Water. ordinary Portland cement with C, A content from 5 to 8 percent shall be desirable to be used in concrete, instead of sulphate resisting cement. Alternatively, Portland slag cement conforming to IS 455 having atleast 50 percent slag or a blend of ordinary Portland cement and slag may be used provided sufficient information is available on performance of such blended cements in these conditions.
</div>

<p><b>8.2.5</b> Mix Constituents</p>

<p><b>8.2.5.1</b> General</p>
<p>For concrete to be durable, careful selection of the mix and materials is necessary, so that deleterious constituents do not exceed the limits.</p>

<p><b>8.2.5.2</b> Chlorides in concrete</p>
<p>Whenever there is chloride in concrete there is an increased risk of corrosion of embedded metal. The higher the chloride content, or if subsequently exposed to warm moist conditions, the greater the risk of corrosion. All constituents may contain chlorides and concrete may be contaminated by chlorides from the external environment. To minimize the chances of deterioration of concrete from harmful chemical salts, the levels of such harmful salts in concrete coming from concrete materials, that is, cement, aggregates water and admixtures, as well as by diffusion from the environment should be limited. The total amount of chloride content (CI) in the concrete at the time of placing shall be as given in Table 7.</p>

<p>The total acid soluble chloride content should be calculated from the mix proportions and the measured chloride contents of each of the constituents. Wherever possible, the total chloride content of the concrete should be determined.</p>

<p><b>8.2.5.3</b> Sulphates in concrete</p>
<p>Sulphates are present in most cements and in some aggregates; excessive amounts of water-soluble sulphate from these or other mix constituents can cause expansion and disruption of concrete. To prevent this, the total water-soluble sulphate content of the concrete mix, expressed as SO<sub>3</sub> where SO<sub>3</sub> = 0.833SO<sub>4</sub> should not exceed 4 percent by mass of the cement in the mix. The sulphate content should be calculated as the total from the various constituents of the mix. The 4 percent limit does not apply to concrete made with super sulphated cement (complying with IS 6909).</p>

<p><b>8.2.5.4</b> Alkali-aggregate reaction</p>
<p>Some aggregates containing particular varieties of silica may be susceptible to attack by alkalis (Na<sub>2</sub>O and K<sub>2</sub>O) originating from cement or other sources, producing an expansive reaction which can cause cracking and disruption of concrete. Damage to concrete from this reaction will normally only occur when all the following are present together:</p>

<p>a) A high moisture level, within the concrete;</p>
<p>b) A cement with high alkali content, or another source of alkali;</p>
<p>c) Aggregate containing an alkali reactive constituent.</p>

<p>Where the service records of particular cement/aggregate combination are well established, and do not include any instances of cracking due to alkali-aggregate reaction, no further precautions should be necessary. When the materials are unfamiliar, precautions should take one or more of the following forms:</p>

<p>a) Use of non-reactive aggregate from alternate sources.</p>
<p>b) Use of low alkali ordinary Portland cement having total alkali content not more than 0.6 percent (as Na<sub>2</sub>O equivalent).</p>

<p>Further advantage can be obtained by use of fly ash ground conforming to IS 3812 (Part 1)or granulated blast furnace slag conforming to IS 12089 as part replacement of ordinary Portland cement (having total alkali content as Na<sub>2</sub>O equivalent not more than 0.6 percent), provided fly ash content is at least 20 percent or slag content is at least 50 percent.</p>

<p>c) Measures to reduce the degree of saturation of the concrete during service such as use of impermeable membranes.</p>
<p>d) Limiting the cement content in the concrete mix and thereby limiting total alkali content in the concrete mix. For more guidance specialist literatures may be referred.</p>

<p><b>8.2.6</b> Concrete in Aggressive Soils and Water</p>

<p><b>8.2.6.1</b> General</p>
<p>The destructive action of aggressive waters on concrete is progressive. The rate of deterioration decreases as the concrete is made stronger and more impermeable, and increases as the salt content of the water increases. Where structures are only partially immersed or are in contact with aggressive soils or waters on one side only evaporation may cause serious concentrations of salts with subsequent deterioration, even where the original salt content of the soil or water is not high.</p>

<div class="note">
    <b>NOTE-</b> Guidance regarding requirements for concrete exposed to sulphate attack is given in 8.2.2.4.
</div>

<p><b>8.2.6.2</b> Drainage</p>
<p>At sites where alkali concentrations are high or may become very high, the ground water should be lowered by drainage so that it will not come into direct contact with the concrete.</p>
<p>Additional protection may be obtained by the use of impermeable barriers.</p>

<p><b>8.2.7</b> Compaction, Finishing and Curing</p>
<p>Adequate compaction without segregation should be ensured by providing suitable workability and by employing appropriate placing and compacting equipment and procedures. Full compaction is particularly important in the vicinity of construction and movement joints and of embedded water bars and reinforcement.</p>
<p>Good finishing practices are essential for durable concrete.</p>
<p>Overworking to the surface and the addition of water cement to aid in finishing should be avoided; the resulting latiance will have impaired strength and durability and will be particularly vulnerable to • freezing and thawing under wet conditions.</p>
<p>It is essential to use proper and adequate curing techniques to reduce the permeability of the concrete. and enhance its durability by extending the hydration of the cement, particularly in its surface zone (see 13.5).</p>

<p><b>8.2.8</b> Concrete in Sea-water</p>
<p>Concrete in sea-water or exposed directly along the sea-coast shall be at least M 20 Grade in the. case of plain concrete and M 30 in case of reinforced concrete. The use of slag or pozzolana cement is advantageous under such conditions.</p>

<p><b>8.2.8.1</b> Special attention shall be given to the design of the mix to obtain the densest possible concrete; slag, broken brick, soft limestone, soft sandstone, or other porous or weak aggregates shall not be used.</p>

<p><b>8.2.8.2</b> As far as possible, preference shall be given to precast members unreinforced, wen-cured and hardened, without sharp corners, and having trowel smooth finished surfaces free Iron crazing, cracks or other defects; plastering should be avoided.</p>

<p><b>8.2.8.3</b> No construction joints' shall be allowed within 600 mm below low water-level or within 600 mm of the upper and lower planes of Wave action. Where unusually severe conditions or abrasion are anticipated, such parts of the work shall be protected by bituminous or silica-fluoride coatings or stone facing bedded with bitumen.</p>

<p><b>8.2.8.4</b> In reinforced concrete structures, care shall be taken to protect the reinforcement from exposure to saline atmosphere during storage, fabrication and use. It may be achieved by treating the surface of reinforcement with cement wash or by suitable methods.</p>

<p><b>9.1.1</b> The determination of the proportions of cement, aggregates and water to attain the required strengths shall be made as follows:</p>

<p>a) By designing the concrete mix; such concrete shall be called 'Design mix concrete', or</p>

<p>b) By adopting nominal concrete mix; such concrete shall be called 'Nominal mix concrete'.</p>

<p>Design mix concrete is preferred to nominal mix. If design mix concrete cannot be used for any reason on the work for grades of M 20 or lower, nominal mixes may be used with the permission of engineer-in-charge, which, however, is likely to involve a higher cement content.</p>

<p>a) Type of aggregate,</p>
<p>b) Maximum cement content, and</p>
<p>c) Whether an admixture shall or shall not be used and the type of admixture and the condition of use.</p>

<b>9.2 Design Mix Concrete</b>

<p><b>9.2.1</b> As the guarantor of quality of concrete used in the construction, the constructor shall carry out the mix design and the mix so designed (not the method of design) shall be approved by the employer within the limitations of parameters and other stipulations laid down by this standard. If so desired, the employer shall be provided with supporting data including graphs showing strength versus water-cement ratio for range of proportions, complete trial mix proportioning details to substantiate the choice of cement content, fine and coarse aggregate content, water, mineral admixtures, chemical admixtures, etc..</p>

<p><b>9.2.2</b> The mix shall be designed to produce the grade of concrete having the required workability and a characteristic strength not less than appropriate values given in Table 2. Proportion/grading of aggregates shall be made by trial in such a way as to make densest possible concrete. The target mean strength of concrete mix should be equal to the characteristic strength plus 1.65 times the standard deviation.</p>

<p><b>9.2.3</b> Mix design done earlier not prior to one year may be considered adequate for later work provided there is no change in source and the quality of the materials.</p>

<p><b>9.2.4</b> Standard Deviation</p>
<p>The standard deviation for each grade of concrete shall be calculated, separately.</p>

<p><b>9.2.4.1</b> Standard deviation based on test strength of sample .</p>

<p>a) Number of test results of samples - The total number of test strength of samples required to constitute an acceptable record for calculation of standard deviation shall be not less than 30 . Attempts should be made to obtain the 30 samples, as early as possible, when a mix is used for the first time.</p>

<p>b) In case of significant changes in concrete When significant changes are made in the production of concrete batches (for example changes in the materials used, mix design, equipment or technical control), the standard deviation value shall be separately calculated for such batches of concrete.</p>

<p>c) Standard deviation to be brought up to date The calculation of the standard deviation shall be brought up to date after every change of mix design.</p>

<p><b>9.2.4.2</b> Assumed standard deviation</p>
<p>Where sufficient test results for a particular grade of concrete are not available, the value of standard deviation given in Table 8 may be assumed for design of mix in the first instance. As soon as the results of samples are available, actual calculated standard deviation shall be used and the mix designed properly. However, when adequate past records for a similar grade exit and justify to the designer a value of standard deviation different from that shown in Table 8, it shall be permissible to use that value</p>

<b>10.2 Batching</b>
<p>To avoid confusion and error in batching, consideration should be given to using the smallest practical number of different concrete mixes on any site Of in anyone plant. In batching concrete, the quantity of both cement and aggregate shall be determined by mass; admixture, if solid, by mass; liquid admixture may however be measured in volume or mass; water shall be weighed or measured by volume in a calibrated tank (see also IS 4925).</p>

<p>For large and medium project sites, the concrete shall be sourced from ready-mixed concrete plants or from captive on-site or off-site automatic batching and mixing plants. The concrete produced and supplied by ready mixed concrete plants shall be in accordance with IS 4926. In case of concrete from captive on-site or off-site automatic batching and mixing plants, similar quality control shall be followed.</p>

<p><b>10.2.1</b> The grading of aggregate should be controlled by obtaining the coarse aggregate in different sizes and blending them in the right proportions, the different sizes being stocked in separate stock-piles.</p>

<p><b>10.2.2</b> The accuracy of the measuring equipment shall be within ± 2 percent of the quantity of cement being 24 measured and within ± 3 percent of the quantity of aggregate, admixtures and water being measured. In a batching plant, the concrete production equipment shall be calibrated initially at the time of installation or reconditioning of the equipment and subsequently at the following intervals:</p>

<p>a) Mechanical knife edge systems: At least once every two months</p>
<p>b) Electrical/ load cell systems : At least once every three months.</p>

<p><b>10.2.3</b> Proportion/Type and grading of aggregates shall be made by trial in such a way so as to obtain densest possible concrete. All ingredients of the concrete should be used by mass except water and chemical admixture which may be by volume.</p>

<p><b>10.2.4</b> Volume batching may be allowed only where weigh-batching is not practical and provided accurate bulk densities of materials to be actually used in concrete have earlier been established. Allowance for bulking shall be made in accordance with IS 2386 (Part 3). The mass volume relationship should be checked as frequently as necessary, the frequency for the given job being determined by engineer-in-charge to ensure that the specified grading is maintained.</p>

<p><b>10.2.5</b> It is important to maintain the water-cement ratio constant at its correct value. To this end, determination of moisture contents in both fine and coarse aggregates shall be made as frequently as possible, the frequency for a given job being determined by the engineer-in-charge according to weather conditions. The amount of the added water shall be adjusted to compensate for any observed variations in the moisture contents. For the determination of moisture content in the aggregates, IS 2386 (Part 3) may be referred to. Where batching plants are used, it is recommended to determine moisture content by moisture probes fitted to the batching plants. To allow for the variation in mass of aggregate due to variation in their moisture content. suitable adjustments in the masses of aggregates shall also be made. In the absence of exact data, only in the case of nominal mixes, the amount of surface water may be estimated from the values given in Table 10.</p>

        <td>a)</td>
        <td>for effective depth 200 mm or less</td>
        <td>±10mm</td>

        <td>b)</td>
        <td>for effective depth more than 200mm</td>
        <td>±15mm</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p><b>12.3.2</b> Tolerance for Cover</p>
<p>Unless specified otherwise, actual concrete cover should not deviate from the required nominal cover ±10mm. Nominal cover as given in 26.4.1 should be specified to all steel reinforcement including links. Spacers between the links (or the bars where no links exist) and the form work should be of the same nominal size as the nominal cover.</p>

<p>Spacers, chairs and other supports detailed on drawings, together with such other supports as may be necessary, should be used to maintain the specified nominal cover to the steel reinforcement. Spacers or chairs should be placed at a maximum spacing of 1m and closer spacing may sometimes be necessary. Spacers, cover blocks should be of concrete of same strength or PVC.</p>

<p><b>12.4</b> Welded Joints or Mechanical Connections Welded joints or mechanical connections in reinforcement may be used but in all cases of important connections, tests shall be made to prove that the joints are of the lull strength of bars connected. Welding of reinforcements shall be done in accordance with the recommendations of IS 2751 and IS 9417.</p>

<p><b>12.5</b> Where reinforcement bars up to 12 mm for high- strength deformed steel bars and up to 16 mm for mild steel bars are bent aside at construction joints and afterwards bent back into their original positions, care should be taken to ensure that at no time is the radius of the bend less than 4 bar diameters for plain mild steel or 6 bar diameters for deformed bars. Care shall also be taken when bending back bars, to ensure that the concrete around the bar is not damaged beyond the band.</p>

<p><b>12.6</b> Reinforcement should be placed and tied in such a way that concrete placement be possible without segregation of the mix. Reinforcement placing should allow compaction by immersion vibrator. Within the concrete mass, different types of metal in contact should be avoided to ensure that bimetal corrosion does not take place.</p>

<div class="subsection-box">
    <b>13 TRANSPORTING, PLACING, COMPACTION AND CURING</b>

<p><b>13.1 Transporting and Handling</b></p>
<p>After mixing, concrete shall be transported to the formwork as rapidly as possible by methods which will prevent the segregation or loss of any of the ingredients Of ingress of foreign matter or water and maintaining the required workability.</p>

<p><b>13.1.1</b> During hot or cold weather, concrete shall be transported in deep containers. Other suitable methods to reduce the loss of water by evaporation in hot weather and heat loss in cold weather may also be adopted.</p>

<p><b>13.2 Placing</b></p>
<p>The concrete shall be deposited. as nearly as practicable in its final position to avoid rehandling. The concrete shall be placed and compacted before initial setting of concrete commences and should not be subsequently disturbed. Methods of placing should be such as to preclude segregation. Care should be taken to avoid displacement of reinforcement or movement of form work. As a general guidance, the maxi mum permissible free fall of concrete may be taken as 1.5 m.</p>

<p><b>13.3 Compaction</b></p>
<p>Concrete should be thoroughly compacted and fully worked around the reinforcement, around embedded fixtures and into corners of the formwork.</p>

<p><b>13.3.1</b> Concrete shall be compacted using mechanical vibrators complying with IS 2505, IS 2506, IS 2514 and IS 4656.</p>

<p>Whenever vibration has to be applied externally, the design of formwork and the disposition of vibrators should receive special consideration to ensure efficient compaction and to avoid surface blemishes.</p>

<p><b>13.4 Construction Joints and Cold Joints</b></p>

<p>Joints are a common source of weakness and, therefore, it is desirable to avoid them. If this is not possible, their number shall be minimized. Concreting shall be carried out continuously up to construction joints, the position and arrangement of which shall be indicated by the designer.</p>

<p>Construction joints shall be placed at accessible locations to permit cleaning out of laitance, cement slurry and unsound concrete, in order to create rough/ uneven surface. It is recommended to clean out laitance and cement slurry by using wire brush on the surface of joint immediately after initial setting of concrete and to clean out the same immediately thereafter. The prepared surface should be in a clean saturated surface dry condition when fresh concrete is placed, against it.</p>

<p>In the case of construction joints at locations where the previous pour has been cast against shuttering the recommended method of obtaining a rough surface for the previously poured concrete is to expose the aggregate with a high pressure water jet or any other appropriate means.</p>

<p>Fresh concrete should be thoroughly vibrated near construction joints so that mortar from the new concrete flows between large aggregates and develop proper bond with old –pnerete.. Where high shear resistance is required at the construction joints, shear keys may be provided. Sprayed curing membranes and release agents should be thoroughly removed from joint surfaces.</p>

<p><b>13.5 Curing</b></p>
<p>Curing is the process of preventing the loss of moisture from the concrete .whilst maintaining a satisfactory temperature regime. The prevention of moisture loss from the concrete is particularly important if the water cement ratio is low, if the cement has a high rate of strength development, if the concrete contains granulated blast furnace slag or pulverised fuel .sh. The curing regime should also prevent the development of high temperature gradients within the concrete.</p>

<p>The rate of strength development at early ages of concrete made with super sulphated cement is significantly reduced at lower temperatures. Super sulphated cement concrete is seriously affected by inadequate curing and the surface has to be kept moist for at least seven days.</p>

<p><b>13.5.1</b> Moist Curing</p>
<p>Exposed surfaces of concrete shall be kept continuously in a damp or wet condition by ponding or by covering with a layer of sacking, canvas, hessian or similar materials and kept constantly wet for at least seven days from the date of placing concrete in case of ordinary Porthind Cement and at least 10 days where mineral admixtures or blended cements are used. The period of curing shall not be less than 10 days for concrete exposed to dry and hot weather conditions. In the case of concrete where mineral admixtures or blended cements are used, it is recommended that above minimum periods may be extended to 14 days.</p>

<p><b>13.5.2</b> Membrane Curing</p>
<p>Approved curing compounds may be used in lieu of moist curing with the permission of the engineer-in charge. Such compounds shall be applied to all exposed surfaces of the concrete as soon as possible after the concrete has set. Impermeable membranes such as polyethylene sheeting covering closely the concrete surface may also be used to provide effective barrier against evaporation.</p>

<p><b>13.6 Supervision</b></p>
<p>It is exceedingly difficult and costly to alter concrete once placed. Hence, constant and strict supervision of all the items of the construction is necessary during the progress of the work, including the proportioning and mixing of the concrete. Supervision is also of extreme importance to check the reinforcement and its placing before being covered.</p>

<p><b>13.6.1</b> Before any important operation; such as concreting or stripping of the formwork is 'started adequate notice shall be given to the construction supervisor.</p>

    <b>14 CONCRETING UNDER SPECIAL CONDITIONS</b>

<p><b>14.1</b> Work in Extreme Weather Conditions During hot or cold weather, the concreting should be done as per the procedure set out in IS 7861 (Part I) or IS 7861 (Part 2).</p>

<p><b>14.2 Under-Water Concreting</b></p>

<p><b>14.2.1</b> When it is necessary to deposit concrete under water, the methods, equipment, materials and proportions of the mix to be used shall be submitted to and approved by the engineer-in-charge before the work is started.</p>

<p><b>14.2.2</b> Under-water concrete should have a slump recommended in 7.1. The water-cement ratio shall not exceed 0.6 for plain cone. and 0.5 for R.C.C and may need to be smaller, depending on the grade of concrete or the type of chemical attack. For aggregates of 10mm, 20mm & 40 mm maximum particle size, the cement content shall be at least 420kg/m³, 380kg/m³ & 350 kg/m³ concrete.</p>

<p><b>14.2.3</b> Coffer-dams or forms shall be sufficiently tight to ensure still water if practicable, and in any case to reduce the flow of water to less than 3m/min through the space into which concrete is to be deposited. Coffer-dams or forms in still water shall be sufficiently tight to prevent loss of mortar through the walls. De-watering by pumping shall not be done while concrete is being placed or until 24 h thereafter.</p>

<p><b>14.2.4</b> Concrete cast under water should not fall freely through the water. Otherwise it may be leached and become segregated. Concrete shall be deposited continuously until it is brought to the required height. While depositing, the top surface shall be kept as nearly level as possible and the formation of seams avoided. The methods to be used for depositing concrete under water shall be one of the following:</p>

<p>a) Tremie-The concrete is placed through vertical pipes the lower end of which is always inserted sufficiently deep into the concrete which has been placed previously but has not set. The concrete emerging from the pipe pushes the material that has already been placed to the side and upwards and thus does not come into direct contact with water.</p>

<p>When concrete is to be deposited under water by means of tremie, the top section of the tremie shall be a hopper large enough to hold one entire batch of the mix or the entire contents the transporting bucket, if any. The tremie pipe shall be not less than 200 mm in diameter and shall be large enough to allow a free flow of concrete and strong enough to withstand the external pressure of the water in which it is suspended, even if a partial vacuum develops inside the pipe. Preferably, flanged steel pipe of adequate strength for the job should be used. A separate lifting device shall be provided for each tremie pipe with its hopper at the upper end. Unless the lower end of the pipe is equipped with an approved automatic check valve, the upper end of the pipe shall be plugged with a wadding of the gunny sacking or other approved material before delivering the concrete to the tremie pipe through the hopper, so that when the concrete is forced down from the hopper to the pipe, it will force the plug (and along with it any water in the pipe) down the pipe and out of the bottom end, thus establishing a continuous stream of concrete. It will be necessary to raise slowly the tremie in order to cause a uniform flow of the concrete, but the tremie shall not be emptied so that water enters the pipe. At all times after the placing of concrete is started and until all the concrete is placed, the lower end of the tremie pipe shall be below the top surface of the plastic concrete. This will cause the concrete to build up from below instead of flowing out over the surface, and thus avoid formation of laitance layers. If the charge in the Tremie is lost while depositing, the tremie shall be raised above the concrete surface, and unless sealed by a check valve, it shall be re-plugged at the top end, as at the beginning, before refilling for depositing concrete.</p>

<p>b) Direct placement with pumps-As in the case of the tremie method, the vertical end piece of the pipe line is always inserted sufficiently deep into the previously cast concrete and should not move to the side during pumping.</p>

<p>c) Drop bottom bucket -The top of the bucket shall be covered with a canvas, flap. The bottom doors shall open freely downward and outward when tripped. The bucket shall be filled completely and lowered slowly to avoid backwash. The bottom doors shall not be opened until the bucket rests on the surface upon which the concrete is to be deposited and when discharged, shall be withdrawn slowly until well above the concrete.</p>

<p>d) Bags -- Bags of at least 0.028 m<sup>3</sup> capacity of jute or other coarse cloth shall be filled about two-thirds full of concrete, the spare end turned under so that bag is square ended and securely tied. They shall be placed carefully in header and stretcher courses so that the whole mass is interlocked. Bags used for this purpose shall be free from deleterious materials.</p>

<p>e) Grouting-A series of round cages made from 50 mm mesh of 6 mm steel and extending over the full height to be concreted shall be prepared and laid vertically over the area to be concreted so that the distance between centres of the cages<sup>1</sup> and also to the faces of the concrete shall not exceed one metre. Stone aggregate of not less than 50 mm nor more than 200 mm size shall be deposited outside the steel cages over the full area and height to be concreted with due care to prevent displacement of the cages.</p>

<p>A stable 1:2 cement-sand grout with a water cement ratio of not less than 0.6 and not more than 0.8 shall be prepared in a mechanical mixer and sent down under pressure (about 0.2 N/mm<sup>2</sup>) through 38 to 50 mm diameter pipes terminating into steel cages, about 50mm above the bottom of the concrete. As the grouting proceeds, the pipe shall be raised gradually up to a height of not more than 6 000 mm above its starting level after which it may be withdrawn and placed into the next cage for further grouting by the same procedure.</p>

<p>After grouting the whole area for a height of about 600 mm, the same operation shall be repeated, if necessary, for the next layer of 600 mm and so on.</p>

<p>The amount of grout to be sent down shall be sufficient to fill all the voids which may be either ascertained or assumed as 55 percent of the volume to be concreted.</p>

<p><b>14.2.5</b> To minimize the formulation of laitance, great care shall be exercised not to disturb the concrete as far as possible while it is being deposited.</p>

These methods include ultrasonic pulse velocity [see IS 13311 (Part 1)] and rebound hammer [IS 13311 (Part 2)], probe penetration, pull out and maturity. Non-destructive tests methods are also core tests for estimating the strength of concrete in a structure, or can supplement the data obtained from a limited number of cores. These methods are useful in measuring a concrete property that bears some relationship to strength. The accuracy of these methods, in part, is determined by the degree of correlation between strength and the physical quantity measured by the test method.</p>
