       h) Hydrophobic cement conforming to IS 8043<br>
       j) Low heat Portland cement conforming to IS 12600<br>
       k) Sulphate resisting Portland cement conforming to IS 12330</p>
    
    <p>Other combinations of Portland cement with mineral admixtures (see 5.2) of quality conforming with relevant Indian Standards laid down may also be used in the manufacture of concrete provided that there are satisfactory data on their suitability, such as performance test on concrete containing them.</p>
    
    <p><strong>5.1.1</strong> Low heat Portland cement conforming to IS 12600 shall be used with adequate precautions with regard to removal of formwork, etc.</p>
    
    <p><strong>5.1.2</strong> High alumina cement conforming to IS 6452 or supersulphated cement conforming to IS 6909 may be used only under special circumstances with the prior approval of the engineer-in-charge. Specialist literature may be consulted for guidance regarding the use of these types of cements.</p>
    
    <p><strong>5.1.3</strong> The attention of the engineers-in-charge and users of cement is drawn to the fact that quality of various cements mentioned in 5.1 is to be determined on the basis of its conformity to the performance characteristics given in the respective Indian Standard Specification for that cement. Any trade-mark or any trade name indicating any special features not covered in the standard or any qualification or other special performance characteristics sometimes claimed/indicated on the bags or containers or in advertisements alongside the 'Statutory Quality Marking' or otherwise have no relation whatsoever with the characteristics guaranteed by the Quality Marking as relevant to that cement. Consumers are, therefore, advised to go by the characteristics as given in the corresponding Indian Standard Specification or seek specialist advise to avoid any problem in concrete making and construction.</p>
    
    <p><strong>5.1.4</strong> At locations where temperature are predominantly below 15°C for 6 months the use of Portland calcined limestone cement should not be permitted in underground structures and structural elements in contact with ground water. Composite cement conforming to IS 16415 and containing a declared clinker content not less than 45% fly ash content not more than 25% and a min 28 day compressive strength of 43 MPa can be used for RCC construction.</p>
    
    <h3>5.2 Mineral Admixtures</h3>
    <p><strong>5.2.1 Pozzolanas</strong></p>
    <p>Pozzolanic materials as given below may be used:</p>
    
    <p><strong>5.2.1.1 Fly ash (pulverized fuel ash)</strong>
    Fly ash conforming to IS 3812 may be used as part replacement of ordinary Portland cement.</p>
    
    <p><strong>5.2.1.2 Silica fume</strong></p>
    <p>Silica fume conforming to IS 15388 be used as part replacement of Cement. ensured.</p>
    <p><strong>NOTE</strong> - The silica fume is usually used in proportion of 5 to 10 percent of the cement content of a mix.</p>
    
    <p><strong>5.2.1.3 Rice husk ash</strong></p>
    <p>Rice husk ash giving required performance and uniformity characteristics may be used with the approval of the deciding authority.</p>
    <p><strong>NOTE</strong> - Rice husk ash is produced by burning rice husk and contain large proportion of silica. To achieve amorphous state, rice husk may be burnt at controlled temperature. It is necessary to evaluate the product from a particular source for performance and uniformity since it can be as deleterious as silt when incorporated in concrete. Water demand and drying shrinkage should be studied before using rice husk.</p>
    
    <p><strong>5.2.1.4 Metakaoline</strong></p>
    <p>Metakaoline conforming to IS 16354 may be used as pozzolanic material in may be used as part replacement of ordinary portland cement.</p>
    <p><strong>NOTE</strong> - Metakaoline is obtained by calcination of pure or refined kaolintic clay at a temperature between 650°C and 850°C, followed by grinding to achieve a fineness of 700 to 900 m²/kg. The resulting material has high pozzolanicity.</p>
    
    <p><strong>5.2.2 Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag</strong>
    Ground granulated blast furnace slag conforming to IS 16714 may be used as part replacement of ordinary Portland cements.</p>
    
    <h3>5.3 Aggregates</h3>
    <p>Aggregates derived from natural source and from other than natural source shall comply with the requirements of IS 383.</p>
    
    <p><strong>5.3.1</strong> Other types of aggregates such as slag and crushed overburnt brick or tile, which may be found suitable with regard to strength, durability of concrete and freedom from harmful effects may be used for plain concrete members, but such aggregates should not contain more than 0.5 percent of sulphates as SO₃ and should not absorb more than 10 percent of their own mass of water.</p>
    
    <p><strong>5.3.2</strong> Heavy weight aggregates or light weight aggregates such as bloated clay aggregates and sintered fly ash aggregates may also be used provided the engineer-in-charge is satisfied with the data on the properties of concrete made with them.</p>
    <p><strong>NOTE</strong> - Some of the provisions of the code would require modification when these aggregates are used; specialist literature may be consulted for guidance.</p>
    
    <p><strong>5.3.3</strong> Size of Aggregate</p>
    <p>The nominal maximum size of coarse aggregate should be as large as possible within the limits specified but in no case greater than one-fourth of the minimum thickness of the member, provided that the concrete can be placed without difficulty so as to surround all reinforcement thoroughly and fill the corners of the form. For most work, 20 mm aggregate is suitable. Where there is no restriction to the flow of concrete into sections, 40 mm or larger size may be permitted. In concrete elements with thin sections, closely spaced reinforcement or small cover, consideration should be given to the use of 10 mm nominal maximum size.</p>
    
    <p>Plums above 160 mm and up to any reasonable size may be used in plain concrete work up to a maximum limit of 20 percent by volume of concrete when specifically permitted by the engineer-in-charge. The plums shall be distributed evenly and shall be not closer than 150 mm from the surface.</p>
    
    <p><strong>5.3.3.1</strong> For heavily reinforced concrete members as in the case of ribs of main beams, the nominal maximum size of the aggregate should usually be restricted to 5 mm less than the minimum clear distance between the main bars or 5 mm less than the minimum cover to the reinforcement whichever is smaller.</p>
    
    <p><strong>5.3.4</strong> Coarse and fine aggregate shall be batched separately.</p>
    
    <h3>5.4 Water</h3>
    <p>Water natural or treated used for mixing and curing shall be clean and free from injurious amounts of oils, acids, alkalis, salts, sugar, organic materials or other substances that may be deleterious to concrete or steel.</p>
    
    <p>Potable water is generally considered satisfactory for mixing concrete. As a guide the following concentrations represent the maximum permissible values:</p>
    <p>a) To neutralize 100 ml sample of water, using phenolphthalein as an indicator, it should not require more than 5 ml of 0.02 normal NaOH. The details of test are given in 8.1 of IS 3025 (Part 22).<br>
       b) To neutralize 100 ml sample of water, using mixed indicator, it should not require more than 25 ml of 0.02 normal H₂SO₄. The details of test shall be given in 8 of IS 3025 (Part 23).<br>
       c) Permissible limits for solids shall be as given in Table 1.</p>

    <p><strong>5.4.1.1</strong> The sample of water taken for testing shall represent the water proposed to be used for concreting, due account being paid to seasonal variation. The sample shall not receive any treatment before testing other than that envisaged in the regular supply of water proposed for use in concrete. The sample than be stored in a clean container previously rinsed out with similar water.</p>
    
    <p><strong>5.4.1.2</strong> Average 28 days compressive strength of at least three 150 mm concrete cubes prepared with water proposed to be used shall not be less than 90 percent of the average of strength of three similar concrete cubes prepared with distilled water. The cubes shall be prepared, cured and tested in accordance with the requirements of IS 516.</p>
    
    <p><strong>5.4.1.3</strong> The initial setting time of test block prepared with the appropriate cement and the water proposed to be used shall not be less than 30 min and shall not differ by ± 30 min from the initial setting time of control test block prepared with the same cement and distilled water. The test blocks shall be prepared and tested in accordance with the requirements of IS 4031 (Part 5).</p>
    
    <p><strong>5.4.2</strong> The pH value of water shall be not less than 6.</p>
    
    <p><strong>5.4.3</strong> Sea Water</p>
    <p>Sea water shall not be used for mixing or curing of concrete shall not be used because of presence of harmful salts in sea water. Under unavoidable circumstances sea water may be used for mixing or curing in plain concrete with no embedded steel after having given due consideration to possible disadvantages and precautions including use of appropriate cement system.</p>
    
    <p><strong>5.4.4</strong> Water found satisfactory for mixing is also suitable for curing concrete. However, water used for curing should not produce any objectionable stain or unsightly deposit on the concrete surface.</p>
    
    <h3>5.5 Chemical Admixtures</h3>
    <p><strong>5.5.1</strong> Admixture, if used, shall comply with IS 9103. Previous experience with and data on such materials should be considered in relation to the likely standards of supervision and workmanship to the work being specified.</p>
    
    <p><strong>5.5.2</strong> Admixtures should not impair durability of concrete nor combine with the constituents to form harmful compounds nor increase the risk of corrosion of reinforcement.</p>
    
    <p><strong>5.5.3</strong> The workability, compressive strength and the slump loss of concrete with and without the use of admixtures shall be established during the trial mixes before use of admixtures.</p>
    
    <p><strong>5.5.4</strong> The relative density of liquid admixtures shall be checked for each drum containing admixtures and compared with the specified value before acceptance.</p>
    
    <p><strong>5.5.5</strong> The chloride content of admixtures shall be independently tested for each batch before acceptance.</p>
    
    <p><strong>5.5.6</strong> If two or more admixtures are used simultaneously in the same concrete mix, data should be obtained to assess their interaction and to ensure their compatibility.</p>
    
    <p><strong>5.5.7</strong> The amount of admixture added to a mix shall be recorded in the production record. Redosing of admixture is not normally be permitted. In special circumstances, if necessary, additional dose of admixture may be added at project site and mixed adequately in mixer itself to regain the workability of concrete with the mutual agreement between producer/supplier and purchaser/user of concrete. However the producer/supplier shall assure the ultimate quality of concrete supplied by him and maintain record of quantity and time of addition.</p>
    
    <h3>5.6 Reinforcement</h3>
    <p>The reinforcement shall be any of the following:</p>
    <p>a) Mild steel and medium tensile steel bars conforming to IS 432 (Part I)<br>
       b) High strength deformed steel bars conforming to IS 1786<br>

    <p><strong>5.6.1</strong> All reinforcement shall be free from loose mill scales, loose rust and coats of paints, oil, mud or any other substances which may destroy or reduce bond. Sand blasting or other treatment is recommended to clean reinforcement.</p>
    
    <p><strong>5.6.2</strong> Special precautions like coating of reinforcement may be required for reinforced concrete elements in exceptional cases and for rehabilitation of structures. Specialist literature may be referred to in such cases. Reduction in design bond strength of coated bars shall be looked into.</p>
    
    <p><strong>5.6.3</strong> The modulus of elasticity of steel shall be taken as 200 kN/mm². The characteristic yield strength of different steel shall be assumed as the minimum yield stress/0.2 percent proof stress specified in the relevant Indian Standard.</p>
    
    <h3>5.7 Fibers</h3>
    <p>Fibers may be added to concrete for special applications to enhance properties, for which special literature may be referred.</p>
    
    <h3>5.8 Storage of Materials</h3>
    <p>Storage of materials shall be as described in IS 4082.</p>
    
    <h2>6 CONCRETE</h2>
    <h3>6.1 Grades</h3>
    <p>The concrete shall be in grades designed as per Table 2.</p>
    
    <p><strong>6.1.1</strong> The characteristic strength is defined as the strength of material, below which not more than 5 percent of the test results are expected to fall.</p>
    
    <p><strong>6.1.2</strong> The minimum grade of concrete for plain and reinforced concrete shall be as per Table 5.</p>
    
    <p><strong>6.1.3</strong> Concrete of grades lower than those given in Table 5 may be used for plain concrete constructions, lean concrete, simple foundations, foundation for masonry walls and other simple or temporary reinforced concrete construction.</p>
    
    <h3>6.2 Properties of Concrete</h3>
    <p><strong>6.2.1 Increase of Strength with Age</strong></p>
    <p>There is normally a gain of strength beyond 28 days. The quantum of increase depends upon the grade and type of cement, curing and environmental conditions, etc. The design should be based on 28 days characteristic strength of concrete unless there is a evidence to justify a higher strength for a particular structure due to age.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>In the designation of concrete mix M refers to the mix and the number to the specified compressive strength of 150 mm size cube at 28 days, expressed in N/mm².</li>
        <li>For concrete of compressive strength greater than M 55, design parameters given in the standard may not be applicable and the values may be obtained from specialized literatures and experimental results.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p><strong>6.2.1.1</strong> For concrete of grade M 30 and above, the rate of increase of compressive strength with age shall be based on actual investigations.</p>
    
    <p><strong>6.2.1.2</strong> Where members are subjected to lower direct load during construction, they should be checked for stresses resulting from combination of direct load and bending during construction.</p>
    
    <p><strong>6.2.2</strong> Tensile Strength of Concrete</p>
    <p>The flexural and splitting tensile strengths shall be obtained as described in IS 516 and IS 5816 respectively. When the designer wishes to use an estimate of the tensile strength from the compressive strength, the following formula may be used:</p>
    
    <pre><code>Flexural strength, fcr = 0.7 √fck N/mm²</code></pre>
    
    <hr>
    
    <p>where fck is the characteristic cube compressive strength of concrete in N/mm².</p>
    
    <p><strong>6.2.3</strong> Elastic Deformation</p>
    <p>The modulus of elasticity is primarily influenced by the elastic properties of the aggregate and to a lesser extent by the conditions of curing and age of the concrete, the mix proportions and the type of cement. The modulus of elasticity is normally related to the compressive strength of concrete.</p>
    
    <p><strong>6.2.3.1</strong> The modulus of elasticity of concrete can be assumed as follows:</p>
    
    <pre><code>Ec = 5000√fck</code></pre>
    
    <hr>
    
    <p>where<br>Ec is the short term static modulus of elasticity in N/mm².<br>Actual measured values may differ by ± 20 percent from the values obtained from the above expression.</p>
    
    <p><strong>6.2.4</strong> Shrinkage</p>
    <p>The total shrinkage of concrete depends upon the constituents of concrete, size of the member and environmental conditions. For a given humidity and temperature, the total shrinkage of concrete is most influenced by the total amount of water present in the concrete at the time of mixing and, to a lesser extent, by the cement content.</p>
    
    <p><strong>6.2.4.1</strong> In the absence of test data, the approximate value of the total shrinkage strain for design may be taken as 0.0003 (for more information, see IS 1343).</p>
    
    <p><strong>6.2.5</strong> Creep of Concrete</p>
    <p>Creep of concrete depends, in addition to the factors listed in 6.2.4, on the stress in the concrete, age at loading and the duration of loading. As long as the stress in concrete does not exceed one-third of its characteristic compressive strength, creep may be assumed to be proportional to the stress.</p>
    
    <p><strong>6.2.5.1</strong> In the absence of experimental data and detailed information on the effect of the variables, the ultimate creep strain may be estimated from the following values of creep coefficient (that is, ultimate creep strain/elastic strain at the age of loading); for long span structure, it is advisable to determine actual creep strain, likely to take place.</p>

    <p><strong>6.2.6</strong> Thermal Expansion</p>
    <p>The coefficient of thermal expansion depends on nature of cement, the aggregate, the cement content, the relative humidity and the size of sections. The value of coefficient of thermal expansion for concrete with different aggregates may be taken as below:</p>

    <h2>7 WORKABILITY</h2>
    <p><strong>7.1</strong> The concrete mix proportions chosen should be such that the concrete is of adequate workability for the placing conditions of the concrete and can properly be compacted with the means available. Suggested ranges of workability of concrete measured in accordance with IS 1199 are given below:</p>
    
    <p><strong>7.1.1</strong> In the 'very low' category of workability where strict control is necessary, for example pavement quality concrete, measurement of workability by determination of compacting factor will be more appropriate than slump (see IS 1199) and a value of compacting factor of 0.75 to 0.80 is suggested.</p>
    
    <p><strong>7.1.2</strong> In the 'very high' category of workability, measurement of workability by determination of flow will be appropriate (see IS 9103).</p>
