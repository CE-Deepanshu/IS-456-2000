      <p>k) Sulphate resisting Portland cement conforming to IS 12330</p>

      <p>Other combinations of Portland cement with mineral admixtures (see <strong>5.2</strong>) of quality 
conforming with relevant Indian Standards laid down may also be used in the manufacture of 
concrete provided that there are satisfactory data on their suitability, such as performance test 
on concrete containing them.</p>

      <p><strong>5.1.1</strong> Low heat Portland cement conforming to IS 12600 shall be used with adequate 
precautions with regard to removal of formwork, etc.</p>

      <p><strong>5.1.2</strong> High alumina cement conforming to IS 6452 or supersulphated cement conforming to 
IS 6909 may be used only under special circumstances with the prior approval of the 
engineer-in-charge. Specialist literature may be consulted for guidance regarding the use of 
these types of cements,</p>

      <p><strong>5.1.3</strong> The attention of the engineers-in-charge and users of cement is drawn to the fact that 
quality of various cements mentioned in <strong>5.1</strong> is to be determined on the basis of its conformity 
to the performance characteristics given in the respective Indian Standard Specification for 
that cement. Any trade-mark or any trade name indicating any special features not covered in 
the standard or any qualification or other special performance characteristics sometimes</p>

      <p>claimed/ indicated on the bags or containers or in advertisements alongside the 'Statutory 
Quality Marking' or otherwise</p>

      <p><strong>5.1.4</strong> At locations where temperature are predominantly below 15°c for 6months the use of 
Portland calcined limestone cement should not be permitted in underground structures and 
structural elements in contact with ground water. have no relation whatsoever with the 
characteristics guaranteed by the Quality Marking as relevant to that cement. Consumers are, 
therefore, advised to go by the characteristics as given in the corresponding Indian Standard 
Specification or seek specialist advise to avoid any problem in concrete making and 
construction. Composite cement conforming to 15 16415 and containing a declared clinker 
content not less than 45% fly ash content not more than 25% and a min 28 day compressive 
strength of 43 MPa can be used for RCC construction.</p>

      <p><strong>5.2 Mineral Admixtures</strong></p>

      <p><strong>5.2.1 Pozzolanas</strong></p>

      <p>Pozzolanic materials  as given below may be used</p>

      <p><strong>5.2.1.1 Fly ash (pulverized fuel ash)</strong></p>

      <p>Fly ash conforming to IS 3812 may be used as part replacement of ordinary Portland cement</p>

      <p>Silica fume conforming to IS 15388 be used as part replacement of Cement. ensured.</p>

      <p>NOTE-The silica fume is usually used in proportion of 5 to 10 percent of the cement content</p>

      <p>of a mix,</p>

      <p><strong>5.2.1.3 Rice husk ash</strong></p>

      <p>Rice husk ash giving required performance and uniformity characteristics may be used with 
the approval of the deciding authority.</p>

      <p>NOTE-Rice husk ash is produced by burning rice husk and contain large proportion of silica. 
To sichieve amorphous state, rice husk may be burnt at controlled temperature. It is necessary 
to evaluate the product from a particular source for performance and uniformity since it can 
be as deleterious as silt when incorporated in concrete. Water deinand and drying shrinkage 
should be studied before using rice husk.</p>

      <p><strong>5.2.1.4 Metakaoline</strong></p>

      <p>Metakaoline conforming to IS 16354 may be used as pozzolanic material in may be used as 
part  replacement of ordinary portland cement.</p>

      <p>NOTE-Metakaoline is obtained by calcination of pure or refined kaolintic clay at a 
temperature between 650°C and 850°C, followed by grinding to achieve a fineness of 700 to 
900 m²/kg. The resulting material has high pozzolanicity.</p>

      <p><strong>5.2.2 Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag</strong></p>

      <p>Ground granulated blast furnace slag conforming to IS 16714 may be used as part 
replacement of ordinary Portland cements.</p>

      <p><strong>5.3 Aggregates</strong></p>

      <p>Aggregates derived from natural source and from other than natural source shall comply with 
the requirements of IS 383.</p>

      <p><strong>5.3.1</strong> Other types of aggregates such as slag and crushed overburnt brick or tiIe, which may 
be found suitable with regard to strength, durability of concrete and freedom from harmful 
effects may be used for plain concrete members, but such aggregates should not contain more 
than 0.5 percent  of sulphates as SO, and should not absorb more than 10 percent  of  their 
own mass of water.</p>

      <p><strong>5.3.2</strong> Heavy weight aggregates or light weight aggregates such as bloated clay aggregates and 
sintered fly ash aggregates may also be used provided the engineer-in-charge is satisfied with 
the data on the properties of concrete made with them. . NOTE-Some of the provisions -of 
the code would require modification when these aggregates are used; specialist literature may 
be consulted for guidance.</p>

      <p><strong>5.3.3 Size of Aggregate</strong></p>

      <p>The nominal maximum size of coarse aggregate should be as large as possible within the 
limits specified but. in no case greater than one-fourth of the minimum thickness of the 
member, provided that the concrete can be placed without difficulty so as to surround all . 
reinforcement thoroughly and fill the corners of the form. For most work, 20 mm aggregate is 
suitable. Where there is no restriction to the flow of concrete into sections, 40 mm or larger 
size may be permitted. In concrete elements with thin sections, closely spaced reinforcement 
or small cover, consideration should be given to the use of 10 mm nominal maximum size. 
Plums above 160 mm and up to any reasonable size may be used in plain concrete work up to 
a maximum limit of :to. percent by volume. of concrete when specifically permitted by the 
engineer-in-charge. The plums shall be distributed evenly and shall be' not closer than 150 
mm from the surface.</p>

      <p><strong>5.3.3.1</strong> For heavily reinforced concrete members as in the case of ribs of main beams, the 
nominal maximum size of the aggregate should usually be restricted to 5 mm less than the 
minimum clear distance between the main bars or 5 mm less than the minimum cover to the 
reinforcement whichever is smaller.</p>

      <p><strong>5.3.4</strong> Coarse and fine aggregate shall be batched separately.</p>

      <p><strong>5.4 Water</strong></p>

      <p>Water natural or treated used for mixing and curing shall be clean and free from-injurious 
amounts of oils,  acids, alkalis, salts, sugar, organic materials or other substances that may be 
deleterious to concrete or steel.</p>

      <p>Potable water is generally considered satisfactory for mixing concrete. As a guide the 
following concentrations represent the maximum permissible values:</p>

      <p>a) To neutralize 100 ml sample of water, using phenolphthalein as an indicator, it should not 
require more than 5 ml of 0.02 normal NaOH. The details of test are given in 8.1 of IS 3025 
(Part 22).</p>

      <p>b) To neutralize 100 rill sample of water, using mixed indicator, it should not require more 
than 25 ml of 0.02 normal H,SO 4' The details of test shall be a. given in 8 of IS 3025 (Part 
23).</p>

      <p>c) Permissible limits for solids shall be as given in Table I.</p>

      <p><strong>5.4.1</strong> In case of doubt regarding development of strength, the suitability of water for making 
concrete shall be ascertained by the compressive strength and initial setting time tests 
specified in 5.4.1.2 and 5.4.1.3.</p>

      <p><strong>5.4.1.1</strong> The sample of water taken for testing shall represent the water proposed to be. used 
for concreting, due account being paid to seasonal variation. The sample shall not receive any 
treatment before testing other than that envisaged in the regular supply' of water proposed for 
use in concrete. The sample than be stored in a clean container previously rinsed out with 
similar water.</p>

      <p><strong>5.4.1.2</strong> Average 28 days compressive strength of at least three 150 mm concrete cubes 
prepared with water proposed to be used shall not be less than 90 percent  of the average. of 
strength. of three similar concrete . cubes prepared with distilled water. The cubes shall be 
prepared, cured and tested in accordance with the . requirements of lS 516.</p>

      <p><strong>5.4.1.3</strong> The initial setting time of test block prepared  with the appropriate cement and the 
water proposed to be. used shall not be less than 30 min and shall not differ by ± 30 min from 
the initial setting time of control . test block prepared with the same cement and distilled 
water. The test blocks shall be prepared and tested in accordance with the requirements of IS 
4031 (Part 5).</p>

      <p><strong>5.4.2</strong> The pH value of water shall be not less than 6.</p>

      <p><strong>5.4.3 Sea Water</strong></p>

      <p>Sea water shall not be used for mixing or curing of concrete shall not be used because  of 
presence of harmful salts in sea water. Under unavoidable circumstances sea water may be 
used for mixing or curing in plain concrete with no embedded steel after having given due 
consideration to possible disadvantages and precautions including use of appropriate cement 
system.</p>

      <p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
      <p>1 In the designation of concrete mix M refers to the mix and the  
number to the specified compressive strength of 150 mrn size  
cub~ at 28 days, expressed in N/rnrn2 .</p>
      <p>2 For concrete of compressive strength greater than M 55, design  
parameters given in the standard may It may not be applicable and the  
values may be obtained from specialized literatures and  
experimental results.</p>

      <p><strong>6.2.1.1</strong> . For concrete of grade M 30 and above, the rate of increase of compressive strength 
with age shall be based on actual investigations.</p>

      <p><strong>6.2.1.2</strong> Where members are subjected to lower direct load during construction, they should be 
checked for stresses resulting from combination of direct load and . bending during 
construction.</p>

      <p><strong>6.2.2 Tensile Strength of Concrete</strong> The flexural and splitting tensile strengths shall be 
obtained as described in IS 516 and 185816 respectively. When the designer wishes to use an 
estimate of the tensile strength from the compressive strength, the following formula may be 
used:</p>

      <p>Flexural strength, fcr = 0.7 √fck  N/mm2</p>

      <p>where fck" is the characteristic cube compressive strength of concrete in N/mm'. <strong>6.2.3 Elastic 
Deformation</strong> The modulus of elasticity is primarily influenced by the elastic properties of the 
aggregate and to a lesser extent by the conditions of curing alld age of the concrete, the mix 
proportions and the type of cement. The modulus of elasticity is normally related to the 
compressive strength of concrete.</p>

      <p><strong>6.2.3 Elastic Deformation</strong></p>

      <p>The modulus of elasticity is primarily influenced by the elastic properties of the aggregate 
and to a lesser extent by the conditions of curing alld age of the concrete, the mix proportions 
and the type of cement. The modulus of elasticity is normally related to the compressive 
strength of concrete.</p>

      <p><strong>6.2.3.1</strong> The modulus of elasticity of concrete can be assumed as follows:</p>

      <p>Ec = 5000√fck</p>

      <p>where</p>

      <p>E, is the short term static modulus of elasticity in N/mm'. Actual measured values may differ 
by ± 20 percent from the values obtained from the above expression.</p>

      <p><strong>6.2.4 Shrinkage</strong> The total shrinkage of concrete depends upon the constituents of concrete, 
size of the member and environmental conditions. For a given humidity and temperature, the 
total shrinkage of concrete is most influenced by the total amount of water present in the 
concrete at the time of mixing and, to a lesser extent, by the cement content.</p>

      <p><strong>6.2.4.1</strong> In the absence of test data, the approximate value of the total shrinkage straiil for 
design may be taken as 0.0003 (for more information, see IS 1343).</p>

      <p><strong>6.2.5 Creep of Concrete</strong> Creep of concrete depends, in addition to the factors listed in 6.2.4, 
on the stress in the concrete, age at loading and the duration of loading. As long as the stress 
in concrete does not exceed one-third of its characteristic compressive strength, creep may be 
assumed to be proportional to the stress ..</p>

      <p><strong>6.2.5.1</strong> In the absence of experimental data and detailed information on the effect of the 
variables, the ultimate creep strain may be estimated from the following values of creep</p>

      <p><strong>6.2.6 Thermal Expansion</strong></p>

      <p>The coefficient of thermal expansion depends on nature of cement, the aggregate, the cement 
content, the relative humidity and the size of sections, The value of coefficient of thermal 
expansion for concrete with different aggregates may be taken as below:</p>

      <p>NOTE-For most of the placing conditions, internal vibrators (needle vibrators) are suitable. The 
diameter of the needle  shall be  determined based on the density and spacing of reinforcement bars 
and thickness of sections. For tremie concrete, 'vibrators are not required to be used (see also 13.3) 
determined based on the density and spacing of reinforcement bars and thickness of sections. For 
trem.ie concrete, 'vibrators are not required to be used (see also 13.3).</p>

      <p><strong>7.1.1</strong> In the 'very low' category of workability where strict control is necessary, for example 
pavement quality concrete, measurement of workability by determination of compacting 
factor will be more appropriate than slump (see IS 1199) and a value of compacting fuctor of 
0.75 to 0.80 is suggested.</p>

      <p><strong>7.1.2</strong> In the 'very high' category of workability, measurement of workability by determination 
of flow will be appropriate (see IS 9103).</p>

      <h2 class="sub-title"><strong>8 DURABILITY OF CONCRETE</strong></h2>

      <p><strong>8.1 General</strong></p>

      <p>A durable concrete is one that performs satisfactorily in the working environment during its 
anticipated exposure conditions during service. The materials and mix proportions specified 
and used should be such as to maintain its integrity and, if applicable, to protect embedded 
metal from corrosion.</p>

      <p><strong>8.1.1</strong> One of the main characteristics influencing the durability of concrete is its permeability 
to the ingress of water, oxygen, carbon dioxide, chloride, sulphate and other potentially 
deleterious substances. Impermeability is governed by the constituents and workmanship 
used in making the concrete. With normal-weight aggregates a suitably low permeability is</p>
