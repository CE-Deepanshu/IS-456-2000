## **18 BASES FOR DESIGN**

### **18.1 Aim of Design**
The aim of design is the achievement of an acceptable probability that structures being designed will perform satisfactorily during their intended life.  
With an appropriate degree of safety, they should sustain all the loads and deformations of normal construction and use and have adequate durability and adequate resistance to the effects of misuse and fire.

---

### **18.2 Methods of Design**

**18.2.1** Structure and structural elements shall normally be designed by **Limit State Method**. Account should be taken of accepted theories, experiment and experience and the need to design for durability.  
Calculations alone do not produce safe, serviceable and durable structures. Suitable materials, quality control, adequate detailing and good supervision are equally important.  

**18.2.2** Where the **Limit State Method** cannot be conveniently adopted, **Working Stress Method** (see Annex B) may be used.  

**18.2.3 Design Based on Experimental Basis**  
Designs based on experimental investigations on models or full-size structure or element may be accepted if they satisfy the primary requirements of 18.1 and subject to experimental details and the analysis connected therewith being approved by the engineer-in-charge.  

**18.2.3.1** Where the design is based on experimental investigation on full-size structure or element, load tests shall be carried out to ensure the following:

**a)** The structure shall satisfy the requirements for deflection (see 23.2) and cracking (see 35.3.2) when subjected to a load for 24 h equal to the characteristic load multiplied by 1.33 γ, where γ shall be taken from Table 18, for the limit state of serviceability.  
If within 24 h of the removal of the load, the structure does not show a recovery of at least 75 percent of the maximum deflection shown during the 24 h under the load, the test loading should be repeated after a lapse of 72 h.  
The recovery after the second test should be at least 75 percent of the maximum deflection shown during the second test.  

> **NOTE —** If the maximum deflection in mm shown during 24 h under load is less than  
> 
> $$
> 40\,\frac{l^2}{D}
> $$
> 
> where *l* is the effective span in m and *D* is the overall depth of the section in mm, it is not necessary for the recovery to be measured.  

**b)** The structure shall have adequate strength to sustain for 24 h a total load equal to the characteristic load multiplied by 1.33 γ, where γ shall be taken from Table 18 for the limit state of collapse.

### **18.3 Durability, Workmanship and Materials**
It is assumed that the quality of concrete, steel and other materials and of the workmanship, as verified by inspections, is adequate for safety, serviceability and durability.  

---

### **18.4 Design Process**
Design, including design for durability, construction and use in service should be considered as a whole.  
The realization of design objectives requires compliance with clearly defined standards for materials, production, workmanship and also maintenance and use of structure in service.

## **19 LOADS AND FORCES**

### **19.1 General**
In structural design, account shall be taken of the dead, imposed and wind loads and forces such as those caused by earthquake, and effects due to shrinkage, creep, temperature, etc., where applicable.  

---

### **19.2 Dead Loads**
Dead loads shall be calculated on the basis of unit weights which shall be established taking into consideration the materials specified for construction.  

**19.2.1** Alternatively, the dead loads may be calculated on the basis of unit weights of materials given in IS 875 (Part 1).  
Unless more accurate calculations are warranted, the unit weights of plain concrete and reinforced concrete made with sand and gravel or crushed natural stone aggregate may be taken as:  

- Plain concrete = 24 kN/m³  
- Reinforced concrete = 25 kN/m³  

---

### **19.3 Imposed Loads, Wind Loads and Snow Loads**
Imposed loads, wind loads and snow loads shall be assumed in accordance with IS 875 (Part 2), IS 875 (Part 3) and IS 875 (Part 4) respectively.  

---

### **19.4 Earthquake Forces**
The earthquake forces shall be calculated in accordance with IS 1893.  

---

### **19.5 Shrinkage, Creep and Temperature Effects**
If the effects of shrinkage, creep and temperature are liable to affect materially the safety and serviceability of the structure, these shall be taken into account in the calculations (see 6.2.4, 6.2.5 and 6.2.6) and IS 875 (Part 5).  

**19.5.1** In ordinary buildings, such as low-rise dwellings whose lateral dimension does not exceed 45 m, the effects due to temperature fluctuations and shrinkage and creep can be ignored in design calculations.  

---

### **19.6 Other Forces and Effects**
In addition, account shall be taken of the following forces and effects if they are liable to affect materially the safety and serviceability of the structure:  

a) Foundation movement (see IS 1904)  
b) Elastic axial shortening  
c) Soil and fluid pressures [see IS 875 (Part 5)]  
d) Vibration  
e) Fatigue  
f) Impact [see IS 875 (Part 5)]  
g) Erection loads [see IS 875 (Part 2)]  
h) Stress concentration effect due to point load and the like.  

---

### **19.7 Combination of Loads**
The combination of loads shall be as given in IS 875 (Part 5).  

---

### **19.8 Dead Load Counteracting Other Loads and Forces**
When dead load counteracts the effects due to other loads and forces in a structural member or joint, special care shall be exercised by the designer to ensure adequate safety for possible stress reversal.  

---

### **19.9 Design Load**
Design load is the load to be taken for use in the appropriate method of design; it is the characteristic load in case of working stress method and characteristic load with appropriate partial safety factors for limit state design.  

---

## **20 STABILITY OF THE STRUCTURE**

### **20.1 Overturning**
The stability of a structure as a whole against overturning shall be ensured so that the restoring moment shall be not less than the sum of:  

- **1.2 × (maximum overturning moment due to characteristic dead load)** and  
- **1.4 × (maximum overturning moment due to characteristic imposed loads)**.  

In cases where dead load provides the restoring moment, only **0.9 × characteristic dead load** shall be considered.  
Restoring moment due to imposed loads shall be ignored.  

**20.1.1** The anchorages or counterweights provided for overhanging members (during construction and service) should be such that static equilibrium should remain, even when overturning moment is doubled.  

---

### **20.2 Sliding**
The structure shall have a factor of safety against sliding of not less than 1.4 under the most adverse combination of the applied characteristic forces.  
In this case, only **0.9 × characteristic dead load** shall be taken into account.  

---

### **20.3 Probable Variation in Dead Load**
To ensure stability at all times, account shall be taken of probable variations in dead load during construction, repair or other temporary measures.  
Wind and seismic loading shall be treated as imposed loading.  

---

### **20.4 Moment Connection**
In designing the framework of a building, provisions shall be made by adequate moment connections or by a system of bracings to effectively transmit all the horizontal forces to the foundations.  

---

### **20.5 Lateral Sway**
Under transient wind load the lateral sway at the top should not exceed **H / 500**, where H is the total height of the building.  
For seismic loading, reference should be made to IS 1893.
