# **SECTION 3 — GENERAL DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS**

## **18 BASES FOR DESIGN**

### **18.1 Aim of Design**
The aim of design is the achievement of an acceptable probability that structures being designed will perform satisfactorily during their intended life.  With an appropriate degree of safety, they should sustain all the loads and deformations of normal construction and use and have adequate durability and adequate resistance to the effects of misuse and fire.

---

### **18.2 Methods of Design**

**18.2.1** Structure and structural elements shall normally be designed by **Limit State Method**. Account should be taken of accepted theories, experiment and experience and the need to design for durability.  Calculations alone do not produce safe, serviceable and durable structures. Suitable materials, quality control, adequate detailing and good supervision are equally important.  

**18.2.2** Where the Limit State Method cannot be conveniently adopted, Working Stress Method (see Annex B) may be used.  

**18.2.3** Design Based on Experimental Basis 
Designs based on experimental investigations on models or full-size structure or element may be accepted if they satisfy the primary requirements of 18.1 and subject to experimental details and the analysis connected therewith being approved by the engineer-in-charge.  

**18.2.3.1** Where the design is based on experimental investigation on full-size structure or element, load tests shall be carried out to ensure the following:

 a) The structure shall satisfy the requirements for deflection (see 23.2) and cracking (see 35.3.2) when subjected to a load for 24 h equal to the characteristic load multiplied by 1.33 γ, where γ shall be taken from Table 18, for the limit state of serviceability. If within 24 h of the removal of the load, the structure does not show a recovery of at least 75 percent of the maximum deflection shown during the 24 h under the load, the test loading should be repeated after a lapse of 72 h. The recovery after the second test should be at least 75 percent of the maximum deflection shown during the second test.  

> **NOTE —** If the maximum deflection in mm shown during 24 h under load is less than  
> 
> $$
> 40\frac{l^2}{D}
> $$
> 
> where *l* is the effective span in m and *D* is the overall depth of the section in mm, it is not necessary for the recovery to be measured.  

 b) The structure shall have adequate strength to sustain for 24 h a total load equal to the characteristic load multiplied by 1.33 γ, where γ shall be taken from Table 18 for the limit state of collapse.  

---

### **18.3 Durability, Workmanship and Materials**
It is assumed that the quality of concrete, steel and other materials and of the workmanship, as verified by inspections, is adequate for safety, serviceability and durability.  

---

### **18.4 Design Process**
Design, including design for durability, construction and use in service should be considered as a whole.  
The realization of design objectives requires compliance with clearly defined standards for materials, production, workmanship and also maintenance and use of structure in service.  

---

## **19 LOADS AND FORCES**

### **19.1 General**
In structural design, account shall be taken of the dead, imposed and wind loads and forces such as those caused by earthquake, and effects due to shrinkage, creep, temperature, etc., where applicable.  

---

### **19.2 Dead Loads**
Dead loads shall be calculated on the basis of unit weights which shall be established taking into consideration the materials specified for construction.  

**19.2.1** Alternatively, the dead loads may be calculated on the basis of unit weights of materials given in IS 875 (Part 1).  
Unless more accurate calculations are warranted, the unit weights of plain concrete and reinforced concrete made with sand and gravel or crushed natural stone aggregate may be taken as:  

- Plain concrete = 24 kN/m³  
- Reinforced concrete = 25 kN/m³  

---

### **19.3 Imposed Loads, Wind Loads and Snow Loads**
Imposed loads, wind loads and snow loads shall be assumed in accordance with IS 875 (Part 2), IS 875 (Part 3) and IS 875 (Part 4) respectively.  

---

### **19.4 Earthquake Forces**
The earthquake forces shall be calculated in accordance with IS 1893.  

---

### **19.5 Shrinkage, Creep and Temperature Effects**
If the effects of shrinkage, creep and temperature are liable to affect materially the safety and serviceability of the structure, these shall be taken into account in the calculations (see 6.2.4, 6.2.5 and 6.2.6) and IS 875 (Part 5).  

**19.5.1** In ordinary buildings, such as low-rise dwellings whose lateral dimension does not exceed 45 m, the effects due to temperature fluctuations and shrinkage and creep can be ignored in design calculations.  

---

### **19.6 Other Forces and Effects**
In addition, account shall be taken of the following forces and effects if they are liable to affect materially the safety and serviceability of the structure:  

a) Foundation movement (see **IS 1904**)  
b) Elastic axial shortening  
c) Soil and fluid pressures [see **IS 875 (Part 5)**]  
d) Vibration  
e) Fatigue  
f) Impact [see **IS 875 (Part 5)**]  
g) Erection loads [see **IS 875 (Part 2)**]  
h) Stress concentration effect due to point load and the like.  

---

### **19.7 Combination of Loads**
The combination of loads shall be as given in **IS 875 (Part 5)**.  

---

### **19.8 Dead Load Counteracting Other Loads and Forces**
When dead load counteracts the effects due to other loads and forces in a structural member or joint, special care shall be exercised by the designer to ensure adequate safety for possible stress reversal.  

---

### **19.9 Design Load**
Design load is the load to be taken for use in the appropriate method of design; it is the characteristic load in case of working stress method and characteristic load with appropriate partial safety factors for limit state design.  

---

## **20 STABILITY OF THE STRUCTURE**

### **20.1 Overturning**
The stability of a structure as a whole against overturning shall be ensured so that the restoring moment shall be not less than the sum of:  

- **1.2 × (maximum overturning moment due to characteristic dead load)** and  
- **1.4 × (maximum overturning moment due to characteristic imposed loads)**.  

In cases where dead load provides the restoring moment, only **0.9 × characteristic dead load** shall be considered. Restoring moment due to imposed loads shall be ignored.  

**20.1.1** The anchorages or counterweights provided for overhanging members (during construction and service) should be such that static equilibrium should remain, even when overturning moment is doubled.  

---

### **20.2 Sliding**
The structure shall have a factor of safety against sliding of not less than 1.4 under the most adverse combination of the applied characteristic forces.  
In this case, only **0.9 × characteristic dead load** shall be taken into account.  

---

### **20.3 Probable Variation in Dead Load**
To ensure stability at all times, account shall be taken of probable variations in dead load during construction, repair or other temporary measures. Wind and seismic loading shall be treated as imposed loading.  

---

### **20.4 Moment Connection**
In designing the framework of a building, provisions shall be made by adequate moment connections or by a system of bracings to effectively transmit all the horizontal forces to the foundations.  

---

### **20.5 Lateral Sway**
Under transient wind load the lateral sway at the top should not exceed **H / 500**, where H is the total height of the building. For seismic loading, reference should be made to **IS 1893**.  

---

## **21 FIRE RESISTANCE**

**21.1** A structure or structural element required to have fire resistance should be designed to possess an appropriate degree of resistance to flame penetration, heat transmission and failure. The fire resistance of a structural element is expressed in terms of time in hours in accordance with **IS 1641**. Fire resistance of concrete elements depends upon member size, cover to steel reinforcement, detailing and type of aggregate (normal-weight or light-weight) used in concrete. Essential requirements of fire safety of building with respect to details of constitution are given in **IS 1642**.

---

**21.2** Minimum requirements of concrete cover and member dimensions for normal-weight aggregate concrete members so as to have the required fire resistance shall be in accordance with **26.4.3** and **Fig. 1** respectively.  

---

**21.3** The reinforcement detailing should reflect the changing pattern of the structural section and ensure that both individual elements and the structure as a whole contain adequate support, ties, bonds and anchorages for the required fire resistance.  

**21.3.1** Additional measures such as application of fire-resistant finishes, provision of fire-resistant false ceilings and sacrificial steel in tensile zone should be adopted in case the nominal cover required exceeds 40 mm for beams and 35 mm for slabs, to give protection against spalling.  

---

**21.4** Specialist literature may be referred to for determining fire resistance of structures which have not been covered in **Fig. 1** or **Table 16A**.

**Notes —**  
1. These minimum dimensions relate specifically to the covers given in **Table 16A**.  
2. *p* is the percentage of steel reinforcement.  

---

## **22 ANALYSIS**

### **22.1 General**
All structures may be analyzed by the **linear-elastic theory** to calculate internal actions produced by design loads.  
In lieu of rigorous elastic analysis, simplified analysis as given in **22.4** for frames and **22.5** for continuous beams may be adopted.  

---

### **22.2 Effective Span**
Unless otherwise specified, the effective span of a member shall be as follows:  

**a)** Simply Supported Beam or Slab — The effective span of a member that is not built integrally with its supports shall be taken as clear span plus the effective depth of slab or beam or centre-to-centre of supports, whichever is less.  

**b)** Continuous Beam or Slab — If the width of support is less than 1/12 of the clear span, the effective span shall be as in (a).  
If the supports are wider than 1/12 of the clear span or 600 mm (whichever is less), the effective span shall be taken as under:  

1. For end span with one end fixed and the other continuous or for intermediate spans — effective span = clear span between supports.  
2. For end span with one end free and the other continuous — effective span = clear span + ½ effective depth of beam or slab, or clear span + ½ width of discontinuous support, whichever is less.  
3. For spans with roller or rocker bearings — effective span = distance between centres of bearings.  

**c)** *Cantilever* — Effective length = length to face of support + <sup>1/ <sub>2 effective depth, except where it forms end of a continuous beam, in which case length to centre of support shall be taken.  

**d)** *Frames* — In the analysis of a continuous frame, centre-to-centre distance shall be used.  

---

### 22.3 Stiffness

**22.3.1** Relative Stiffness
The relative stiffness of members may be based on moment of inertia determined from:  

a) **Gross section** — cross-section ignoring reinforcement.  
b) **Transformed section** — concrete cross section plus the area of reinforcement transformed on the basis of modular ratio (see **B-1.3**).  
c) **Cracked section** — The area of concrete in compression plus the area of reinforcement transformed on the basis of modular ratio  

The assumptions made shall be consistent for all members throughout any analysis.  

**22.3.2** For deflection calculations, appropriate values of moment of inertia as specified in **Annex C** should be used. 

---

### **22.4 Structural Frames** 
Simplifying assumptions as given in 22.4.1 to 22.4.3 may be used in analysis of frames.  

**22.4.1** Arrangement of Imposed Load
a) Consideration may be limited to:  
1. Design dead load on all spans with full design imposed load on **two adjacent spans**, and  
2. Design dead load on all spans with full design imposed load on **alternate spans**.  

b) When design imposed load ≤ ¾ design dead load, assume design dead + imposed load on all spans.  

> **NOTE —** For beams and slabs continuous over supports, 22.4.1 (a) may be assumed.  

**22.4.2 Substitute Frame** For determining moments and shears at any floor or roof level due to gravity loads, the beams at that level together with columns above and below, with their far ends fixed, may be considered to constitute the frame.  

**22.4.2.1** Where side-sway consideration becomes critical due to unsymmetry in geometry or loading, rigorous analysis may be required.  

**22.4.3** For lateral loads, simplified methods may be used for symmetrical structures may be used to obtain moments and shear for structures that are symmetrical. For unsymmetrical or very tall structures, more rigorous methods should be used.  

---

### **22.5 Moment and Shear Coefficients for Continuous Beams**

**22.5.1**
Unless more exact estimates are made, for beams of uniform cross-section which support substantially uniformly distributed loads over **three or more spans** (not differing by more than 15 % of the longest), bending moments and shear forces may be obtained using coefficients in **Table 12** and **Table 13**.  

For moments at supports where two unequal spans meet, or spans are unequally loaded, take average of the two values for negative moment.  Where coefficients in **Table 12** are used, redistribution referred to in **22.7** shall not be permitted.  

**22.5.2** Beams and Slabs Over Free End Supports
Where a member is built into a masonry wall developing only partial restraint, design for a negative moment at face of support of **Wl / 24**, where *W* = total design load and *l* = effective span, or such restraining moment as may be shown to be applicable.  For such condition, shear coefficient in **Table 13** at end support may be increased by 0.05.

---

### **22.6 Critical Sections for Moment and Shear**

**22.6.1** For monolithic construction, use moments computed at the face of supports for design at those sections. For non-monolithic construction, design in accordance with **22.2**.  

**22.6.2** Critical Section for Shear
The shears computed at the face of support shall be used in the design for member at that section, except as in 22.6.2.1.  

**22.6.2.1** When the reaction in the direction of applied shear introduces compression into the end region of the member, sections located at a distance &lt; *d* from the face of support may be designed for same shear as computed at distance *d*.  

> **NOTE —** The above clauses are applicable for beams generally carrying uniformly distributed load or where principal load is located farther than 2*d* from the support face.  

<img width="522" height="421" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1806b23-395a-49a2-a8a4-489811cd35c3" />

---

### **22.7 Redistribution of Moments**
Redistribution of moments may be done in accordance with **37.1.1** for limit-state method and **B-1.2** for working-stress method. However, when simplified analysis using coefficients is adopted, redistribution shall not be done.  

---

## **23 BEAMS**

### **23.0 Effective Depth**
Effective depth of a beam is the distance between centroid of tension reinforcement and maximum compression fibre, excluding thickness of finishing material not placed monolithically and any concrete provided to allow for wear. This will not apply to deep beams.  

---

### **23.1 T-Beams and L-Beams**

**23.1.1 General**

A slab which is assumed to be acting as compression flange of a T-beam or L-beam shall satisfy:  

a) Slab shall be cast integrally with web, or the web and the slab shall be effectively bonded by other manners; and.  
b) If main reinforcement of slab is parallel to beam, transverse reinforcement shall be provided as in **Fig. 3**; such reinforcement shall not be less than 60 % of the main reinforcement at mid-span of the slab.  

**23.1.2** Effective Width of Flange

In absence of more accurate determination, effective width of flange may be taken as below, but not greater than the breadth of web plus half the sum of clear distances to adjacent beams on either side.  

a) For T-beams 

$$
b_f = \frac{l_0}{6} + b_w + 6D_f
$$  

b) For L-beams 

$$
b_f = \frac{l_0}{12} + b_w + 3D_f
$$  

c) For isolated beams, effective flange width shall be obtained as below, but not greater than actual width.  


**For T-beam:**

$$
b_f = \frac{l_0}{\left(\frac{l_0}{b}\right) + 4} + b_w
$$

**For L-beam:**

$$
b_f = \frac{0.5\,l_0}{\left(\frac{l_0}{b}\right) + 4} + b_w
$$
 

where:  

- *b<sub>f</sub>* = effective width of flange  
- *l<sub>0</sub>* = distance between points of zero moments in beam  
- *b* = breadth of web  
- *D<sub>f</sub>* = thickness of flange  
- *B* = actual width of flange  

> **NOTE —** For continuous beams and frames, *l* may be assumed as 0.7 times effective span.  

<img width="975" height="694" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49a93d37-5fb9-4883-af55-5d557ce6e6d5" />

---

### **23.2 Control of Deflection**

Deflection of a structure or part thereof shall not adversely affect appearance or efficiency of the structure, finishes or partitions. The deflection shall generally be limited to:  

a) Final deflection due to all loads, including temperature, creep and shrinkage and measured from as-cast level of supports of floors, roofs and other horizontals should not normally excedd span / 250.  

b) Deflection  including temperature, creep and shrinkage occurring after erection of partition and application of finishes should not normally excedd ≤ span / 350 or 20 mm, whichever is less.  

**23.2.1** Vertical deflection limits may genrally be assumed to be satisfied if span-to-depth ratios do not exceed the values obtained as follows:  

a) Basic values of span to effective depth ratios for spans up to 10 m:

| Type of Beam       | Span to Depth Ratio |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| Cantilever         | 7                   |
| Simply supported   | 20                  |
| Continuous         | 26                  |

b) For spans above 10 m, the values in (a) may be multiplied by 10/span in metres, except for cantilever in which case deflection calculations should be made.

c) Depending on the area and the stress of steel for tension reinforcement, the values in (a) or (b) shall be modified by multiplying with the modification factor obtained as per Fig. 4.

d) Depending on the area of compression reinforcement, the value of span to depth ratio be further modified by multiplying with the modification factor obtained as per Fig. 5.

e) For flanged beams, the values of (a) or (b) be modified as per Fig. 6 and the reinforcement percentage for use in Fig. 4 and 5 should be based on area of section equal to b₁ d.
NOTE—When deflections are required to be calculated, the method given in Annex C may be used.

---

## 24 SOLID SLABS

### 24.1 General
The provisions of 23.2 for beams apply to slabs also.

NOTES
**1** For slabs spanning in two directions, the shorter of the two spans should be used for calculating the span to effective depth ratios.
**2** For two-way slabs of shorter spans (up to 3.5 m) with mild steel reinforcement, the span to overall depth ratios given below may generally be assumed to satisfy vertical deflection limits for loading class up to 3 kN/m².
Simply supported slabs – 35
Continuous slabs – 40
For high strength deformed bars of grade Fe 415, the values given above should be multiplied by 0.8.

---

### **24.2 Slabs Continuous Over Supports**
Slabs spanning in one direction and continuous over supports shall be designed according to the provisions applicable to continuous beams.

---

### **24.3 Slabs Monolithic with Supports**
Bending moments in slabs (except flat slabs) constructed monolithically with the supports shall be calculated by taking such slabs either as continuous over supports and. capable of free rotation, or as members of a continuous framework with the supports, taking into account the stiffness of such supports. If such supports are formed into beams which justify fixity at the support of the slab, then the effects on the supporting beam, such as, the bending of the web in the transverse direction of the beam and the torsion in the longitudinal direction of the beam, wherever applicable, shall also be considered in the design of the beam.

**24.3.1** For the purpose of calculation of moments in slabs in a monolithic structure, it will generally be sufficiently accurate to assume that members connected to the ends of such slabs are fixed in position and direction at the ends remote from their connections with the slabs.

**24.3.2** Slabs Carrying Concentrated Load

**24.3.2.1** If a solid slab supported on two opposite edges, carries concentrated loads the maximum bending moment caused by the concentrated loads will be assumed to be resisted by an effective width of slab (measured parallel to the supporting edges) as follows:

a) For a single concentrated load, the effective width shall be calculated in accordance with the following equation provided that the load does not exceed the actual width of the slab:
b<sub>ef</sub> = kx(1−l<sub>ef</sub>/x)+a
where
b<sub>ef</sub> = effective width of slab,
k = constant having the values given in Table 14 depending upon the ratio of the width of the slab (b′) to the effective span l′<sub>ef</sub>,
x = distance of the centroid of the concentrated load from nearer support,
l<sub>ef</sub> = effective span, and
a = width of the contact area of the concentrated load from nearer support measured parallel to the supported edge.

And provided further that in case of a load near the unsupported edge of a slab, the effective width shall not exceed the above value nor half the above value plus the distance of the load from the unsupported edge.

**b)** For two or more concentrated loads placed in a line in the direction of the span, the bending moment per metre width of slab shall be calculated separately for each load according to its appropriate effective width of slab calculated as in (a) above, and added together for design calculations.

**c)** For two or more loads not in a line in the direction of the span, if the effective width of slab for one load does not overlap the effective width of slab for another load, both calculated as in (a) above, then the slab for each load can be designed separately. If the effective width of slab for one load overlaps the effective width of slab for an adjacent load, the overlapping portion of the slab shall be designed for the combined effect of the two loads.

**Table 14 Values of k for Simply Supported and Continuous Slabs**
**(Clause 24.3.2.1)**

| b′/l<sub>ef      | k for Simply Supported Slabs | k for Continuous Slabs |
| :--------------- | :--------------------------- | :--------------------- |
| 0.1              | 0.4                          | 0.4                    |
| 0.2              | 0.8                          | 0.8                    |
| 0.3              | 1.16                         | 1.16                   |
| 0.4              | 1.48                         | 1.44                   |
| 0.5              | 1.72                         | 1.68                   |
| 0.6              | 1.96                         | 1.84                   |
| 0.7              | 2.12                         | 1.96                   |
| 0.8              | 2.24                         | 2.06                   |
| 0.9              | 2.36                         | 2.16                   |
| 1.0 and above    | 2.48                         | 2.24                   |

**d)** For cantilever solid slabs, the effective width shall be calculated in accordance with the following equation:
b<sub>ef</sub> = 1.2a<sub>1</sub> + a
where
b<sub>ef</sub> = effective width,
a<sub>1</sub> = distance of the concentrated load from the face of the cantilever support, and
a = width of contact area of the concentrated load measured parallel to the supporting edge.

Provided that the effective width of the cantilever slab shall not exceed one-third the length of the cantilever slab measured parallel to the fixed edge. And provided further that when the concentrated load is placed near the extreme ends of the length of cantilever slab in the direction parallel to the fixed edge, the effective width shall not exceed the above value, nor shall it exceed half the above value plus the distance of the concentrated load from the extreme end measured in the direction parallel to the fixed edge.

**24.3.2.2** For slabs other than solid slabs, the effective width shall depend on the ratio of the transverse and longitudinal flexural rigidities of the slab. Where this ratio is one, that is, where the transverse and longitudinal flexural rigidities are approximately equal, the value of effective width as found for solid slabs may be used. But as the ratio decreases, proportionately smaller value shall be taken.

**24.3.2.3** Any other recognized method of analysis for cases of slabs covered by 24.3.2.1 and 24.3.2.2 and for all other cases of slabs may be used with the approval of the engineer-in-charge.

**24.3.2.4** The critical section for checking shear shall be as given in 34.2.4.1.

---

### **24.4 Slabs Spanning in Two Directions at Right Angles**

The slabs spanning in two directions at right angles and carrying uniformly distributed load may be designed by any acceptable theory or by using coefficients given in Annex D. For determining bending moments in slabs spanning in two directions at right angles and carrying concentrated load, any accepted method approved by the engineer-in-charge may be adopted.

**NOTE**—The most commonly used elastic methods are based on Pigeaud's or Wester-guard's theory and the most commonly used limit state of collapse method is based on Johansen's yield- line theory.

**24.4.1 Restrained Slab with Unequal Conditions at Adjacent Panels**
In some cases the support moments calculated from Table 26 for adjacent panels may differ significantly. The following procedure may be adopted to adjust them:

**a)** Calculate the sum of moments at midspan and supports (neglecting signs) average of the support moment(- ve sign) for each panel.

**b)** Treat the values from Table 26 as fixed end moments.

**c)** According to the relative stiffness of adjacent spans, distribute the fixed end moments across the supports, giving new support moments.

**d)** Adjust midspan moment such that, when added to the support moments from (c) (neglecting signs), the total should be equal to that from (a).

If the resulting support moments are significantly greater than the value from Table 26, the tension steel over the supports will need to be extended further. The procedure should be as follows:

**1)** Take the span moment as parabolic between supports: its maximum value is as found from (d).

**2)** Determine the points of contraflexure of the new support moments [from (c)] with the span moment [from (1)].

**3)** Extend half the support tension steel at each end to at least an effective depth or 12 bar diameters beyond the nearest point of contraflexure.

**4)** Extend the full area of the support tension steel at each end to half the distance from (3).

---

**24.5 Loads on Supporting Beams**
The loads on beams supporting solid slabs spanning in two directions at right angles and supporting uniformly distributed loads, may be assumed to be in accordance with Fig. 7.

<img width="933" height="659" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e7556dc-d1e4-477d-b29d-18e2799f6d2b" />

## **25 COMPRESSION MEMBERS**

### **25.1 Definitions**

**25.1.1** Column or strut is a compression member, the effective length of which exceeds three times the least lateral dimension.

**25.1.2** Short and Slender Compression Members
A compression member may be considered as short when both the slenderness ratios $$\frac{l_ex}{D}$$ and $$\frac{l_ey}{b}$$ are less than 12:
where
l<sub>ex</sub> = effective length in respect of the major axis,
D = depth in respect of the major axis,
l<sub>ey</sub> = effective length in respect of the minor axis, and
b = width of the member.
It shall otherwise be considered as a slender compression member.

**25.1.3** Unsupported Length

The unsupported length l, of a compression member shall be taken as the clear distance between end restraints except that:

a) in flat slab construction, it shall be clear distance between the floor and the lower extremity of the capital, the drop panel or slab whichever is the least.

b) in beam and slab construction, it shall be the clear distance between the floor and the underside of the shallower beam framing into the columns in each direction at the next higher floor level.

c) in columns restrained laterally by struts, it shall be the clear distance between consecutive struts in each vertical plane, provided that to be an adequate support, two such struts shall meet the columns at approximately the same level and the angle between vertical planes through the struts shall not vary more than 30° from a right angle. Such struts shall be of adequate dimensions and shall have sufficient anchorage to restrain the member against lateral deflection.

d) in columns restrained laterally by struts or beams, with brackets used at the junction, it shall be the clear distance between the floor and the lower edge of the bracket, provided that the bracket width equals that of the beam strut and is at least half that of the column.

### **25.2 Effective Length of Compression Members**
In the absence of more exact analysis, the effective length l<sub>ef</sub> of columns may be obtained as described in Annex E.

---

### **25.3 Slenderness Limits for Columns**

**25.3.1** The unsupported length between end restraints shall not exceed 60 times the least lateral dimension of a column.

**25.3.2** If, in any given plane, one end of a column is unrestrained, its unsupported length, l, shall not exceed 100b²/D
where
b = width of that cross-section, and
D = depth of the cross-section measured in the plane under consideration.

---

### **25.4 Minimum Eccentricity**
All columns shall be designed for minimum eccentricity, equal to the unsupported length of column/500 plus lateral dimensions/30, subject to a minimum of 20 mm. Where bi-axial bending is considered, it is sufficient to ensure that eccentricity exceeds the minimum about one axis at a time.

## **26 REQUIREMENTS GOVERNING REINFORCEMENT AND DETAILING**

### **26.1 General**
Reinforcing steel of same type and grade shall be used as main reinforcement in a structural member. However, simultaneous use of two different types or grades of steel for main and secondary reinforcement respectively is permissible.

**26.1.1** Bars may be arranged singly, or in pairs in contact, or in groups of three or four bars bundled in contact. Bundled bars shall be enclosed within stirrups or ties. Bundled bars shall be tied together to ensure the bars remaining together. Bars larger than 32 mm diameter shall not be bundled, except in columns. Congestion of reinforcement should be avoided during detailing. Various methods such as choosing the diameter and grade of steel carefully and bundling of reinforcement, if required, are available.

**26.1.2** The recommendations for detailing for earthquake-resistant construction given in IS 13920 should be taken into consideration, where applicable (see also IS 4326). 

---

**26.2 Development of Stress in Reinforcement**
The calculated tension or compression in any bar at any section shall be developed on each side of the section by an appropriate development length or end anchorage or by a combination therefore.

**26.2.1 Development Length of Bars**
The development length L<sub>d</sub> is given by
L<sub>d</sub> = φ σ<sub>s</sub> / 4 τ<sub>bd</sub>
where
φ = nominal diameter of the bar,
σ<sub>s</sub> = stress in bar at the section considered at design load, and
τ<sub>bd</sub> = design bond stress given in 26.2.1.1.

**NOTES**
1 The development length includes anchorage values of hooks in tension reinforcement.
2 For bars of sections other than circular, the development length should be sufficient to develop the stress in the bar by bond.
3 For plain cement concrete of M15 grade with nominal reinforcement, the design bond stress may be taken as 1.0 N/mm²

**26.2.1.1 Design bond stress in limit state method for plain bars in tension shall be as below:**

| Grade of Concrete | Design bond stress, τ<sub>bd</sub> N/mm² |
| :---------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| M20               | 1.2                                      |
| M25               | 1.4                                      |
| M30               | 1.5                                      |
| M35               | 1.7                                      |
| M40 and above     | 1.9                                      |

For deformed bars conforming to IS 1786 these values shall be increased by 60 percent.
For bars in compression, the values of bond stress for bars in tension shall be increased by 25 percent. For fusion bonded epoxy coated deformed bars, design bond stress values shall be taken as 80 percent of the values conforming to IS 1786.
The values of bond stress in working stress design, are given in B-2.1.

**26.2.1.2** Bars bundled in contact
The development length of each bar of bundled bars shall be that for the individual bar, increased by 10 percent for two bars in contact, 20 percent for three bars in contact and 33 percent for four bars in contact.

**26.2.2** Anchoring Reinforcing Bars

**26.2.2.1** Anchoring bars in tension
a) Deformed bars may be used without end anchorages provided development length requirement is satisfied. Hooks should normally be provided for plain bars in tension.
b) Bends and hooks — Bends and hooks shall conform to IS 2502
 1) Bends - The anchorage value of bend shall be taken as 4 times the diameter of the bar for each 45° bend subject to a maximum of 16 times the diameter of the bar.
 2) Hooks - The anchorage value of a standard U-type hook shall be equal to 16 times the diameter of the bar.

**26.2.2.2** Anchoring bars in compression
The anchorage length of straight bar in compression shall be equal to the development length of bars in compression as specified in **26.2.1.** The projected length of hooks, bends and straight lengths beyond bends if provided for a bar in compression, shall only be considered for development length.

**26.2.2.3** Mechanical devices for anchorage
Any mechanical or other device capable of developing the strength of the bar without damage to concrete may be used as anchorage with the approval of the engineer-in-charge.

**26.2.2.4** Anchoring shear reinforcement

a) Inclined bars - The development length shall be as for bars in tension; this length shall be measured as under:

 1) In tension zone, from the end of the sloping or inclined portion of the bar, and
 2) In the compression zone, from the mid depth of the beam.
  
b) Stirrups-Not withstanding any of the provisions of this standard, in case of secondary reinforcement, such as stirrups and transverse ties, complete development lengths and anchorage shall be deemed to have been provided when the bar is bent through an angle of at least 90° round a bar of at least its own diameter and is continued beyond the end of the curve for a length of at least eight diameters, or when the bar is bent through an angle of 135° and is continued beyond the end of the curve for a length of at least six bar diameters or when the bar is bent through an angle of 180° and is continued beyond the end of the curve for a length of at least four bar diameters.

**26.2.2.5** Bearing stresses at bends

The bearing stress in concrete for bends and hooks described in IS 2502 need not be checked. The bearing stress inside a bend in any other bend shall be calculated as given below:

Bearing stress = $$\frac{F_bt}{rφ}$$

where

F<sub>bt</sub> = tensile force due to design loads in a bar or group of bars,

r = internal radius of the bend, and

φ = size of the bar or, in bundle, the size of bar of equivalent area.

For limit state method of design, this stress shall not exceed 1.5f<sub>ck</sub> / (1+2φ/a) where f<sub>ck</sub> is the characteristic cube strength of concrete and a, for a particular bar or group of bars in contact shall be taken as the centre to centre distance between bars or groups of bars perpendicular to the plane of the bend; for a bar or group of bars adjacent to the face of the member a shall be taken as the cover plus size of bar (φ). For working stress method of design, the bearing stress shall not exceed 1.5f<sub>ck</sub> / (1+2φ/a)

**26.2.2.6** If a change in direction of tension or compression reinforcement induces a resultant force acting outward tending to split the concrete, such force should be taken up by additional links or stirrups. Bent tension bar at a re-entrant angle should be avoided.

**26.2.3** Curtailment of Tension Reinforcement in Flexural Members

**26.2.3.1** For curtailment, reinforcement shall extend beyond the point at which it is no longer required to resist flexure for a distance equal to the effective depth of the member or 12 times the bar diameter, whichever is greater except at simple support or end of cantilever. In addition **26.2.3.2** to **26.2.3.5** shall also be satisfied.

**NOTE**-A point at which reinforcement is no longer required to resist flexure is where the resistance moment of the section, considering only the continuing bars, is equal to the design moment.

**26.2.3.2** Flexural reinforcement shall not be terminated in a tension zone unless any one of the following conditions is satisfied:

a) The shear at the cut-off point does not exceed two-thirds that permitted, including the shear strength of web reinforcement provided.

b) Stirrup area in excess of that required for shear and torsion is provided along each terminated bar over a distance from the cut-off point equal to three-fourths the effective depth of the member. The excess stirrup area shall be not less than 0.4 bs/f<sub>y</sub>, where b is the breadth of beam, s is the spacing and f<sub>y</sub> is the characteristic strength of reinforcement in N/mm². The resulting spacing shall not exceed d/8β<sub>b</sub>, where β<sub>b</sub> is the ratio of the area of bars cut-off to the total area of bars at the section, and d is the effective depth.

c) For 36 mm and smaller bars, the continuing bars provide double the area required for flexure at the cut-off point and the shear does not exceed three-fourths that permitted.

**26.2.3.3** Positive moment reinforcement

a) At least one-third the positive moment reinforcement in simple members and one-fourth the positive moment reinforcement in continuous members shall extend along the same face of the member into the support, to a length equal to L<sub>d</sub>/3.

b) When a flexural member is part of the primary lateral load resisting system, the positive reinforcement required to be extended into the support as described in (a) shall be anchored to develop its design stress in tension at the face of the support.

c) At simple supports and at points of inflection, positive moment tension reinforcement shall be limited to a diameter such that L<sub>d</sub> computed for f<sub>d</sub> by 26.2.1 does not exceed M<sub>1</sub>/V + L<sub>0</sub>

where

M<sub>1</sub> = moment of resistance of the section assuming all reinforcement at the section to be stressed to f<sub>d</sub>

f<sub>d</sub> = 0.87 f<sub>y</sub>, in the case of limit state design and the permissible stress σ<sub>s</sub> in the case of working stress design;

V = shear force at the section due to design loads;

L<sub>0</sub> = sum of the anchorage beyond the centre of the support and the equivalent anchorage value of any hook or mechanical anchorage at simple support; and at a point of inflection, L<sub>0</sub> is limited to the effective depth of the members or 12φ, whichever is greater, and

φ = diameter of bar,

The value of M<sub>1</sub>/V in the above expression may be increased by 30 percent when the ends of the reinforcement are confined by a compressive reaction.

**26.2.3.4** Negative moment reinforcement

At least one-third of the total reinforcement provided for negative moment at the support shall extend beyond the point of inflection for a distance not less than the effective depth of the member of 12φ or one-sixteenth of the clear span whichever is greater.

**26.2.3.5** Curtailment of bundled bars

Bars in a bundle shall terminate at different points spaced apart by not less than 40 times the bar diameter except for bundles stopping at a support.

**26.2.4** Special Members

Adequate end anchorage shall be provided for tension reinforcement in flexural members where reinforcement stress is not directly proportional to moment, such as sloped, stepped, or tapered footings; brackets; deep beams; and members in which the tension reinforcement is not parallel to the compression face.

**26.2.5** Reinforcement Splicing

Where splices are provided in the reinforcing bars, they shall as far as possible be away from the sections of maximum stress and be staggered. It is recommended that splices in flexural members should not be at sections where the bending moment is more than 50 percent of the moment of resistance; and not more than half the bars shall be spliced at a section. Where more than one-half of the bars are spliced at a section or where splices are made at points of maximum stress, special precautions shall be taken, such as increasing the length of lap and/or using spirals or closely-spaced stirrups around the length of the splice.

**26.2.5.1** Lap splices

a) Lap splices shall not be used for bars larger than 36 mm; bars larger than 36 mm shall be welded (see **12.4**) or mechanically spliced.

b) Lap splices shall be considered as staggered if the centre to centre distance of the splices is not less than 1.3 times the lap length calculated as described in (c).

c) Lap length including anchorage value of hooks for bars in flexural tension shall be L<sub>d</sub> (see 26.2.1) or 30φ whichever is greater and for direct tension shall be 2L<sub>d</sub> or 300 mm whichever is greater. The straight length of the lap shall not be less than 15φ or 200 mm. The following provisions shall also apply:
Where lap occurs for a tension bar located at:
 1) top of a section as cast and the minimum cover is less than twice the diameter of the lapped bar, the lap length shall be increased by a factor of 1.4.
 2) corner of a section and the minimum cover to either face is less than twice the diameter of the lapped bar or where the clear distance between adjacent laps is less than 75 mm or 6 times the diameter of lapped bar, whichever is greater, the lap length should be increased by a factor of 1.4.
Where both condition (1) and (2) apply, the lap length should be increased by a factor of 2.0.
**NOTE**-Splices in tension members shall be enclosed in spirals made of bars not less than 6 mm diameter with pitch not more than 100 mm.

 d) The lap length in compression shall be equal to the development length in compression, calculated as described in 26.2.1, but not less than 24φ.

 e) When bars of two different diameters are to be spliced, the lap length shall be calculated on the basis of diameter of the smaller bar.

 f) When splicing of welded wire fabric is to be carried out, lap splices of wires shall be made so that overlap measured between the extreme cross wires shall be not less than the spacing of cross wires plus 100 mm.

 g) In case of bundled bars, lapped splices of bundled bars shall be made by splicing one bar at a time; such individual splices within a bundle shall be staggered. Reinforcement couplers for mechanical splices of bars for concrete reinforcement, used, shall be in accordance with IS 16172.

**26.2.5.2** Strength of welds
The following values may be used where the strength of the weld has been proved by tests to be at least as great as that of the parent bar.
a) Splices in compression — For welded splices and mechanical connection, 100 percent of the design strength of joined bars.
b) Splices in tension
 1) 80 percent of the design strength of welded bars (100 percent if welding is strictly supervised and if at any cross-section of the member not more than 20 percent of the tensile reinforcement is welded).
 2) 100 percent of design strength of mechanical connection.

**26.2.5.3 End-bearing splices**
End-bearing splices shall be used only for bars in compression. The ends of the bars shall be square cut and concentric bearing ensured by suitable devices.
